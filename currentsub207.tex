 Understanding how disease patterns evolve over a lifetime remains a key challenge in medicine. While electronic health records provide rich longitudinal data, existing models typically analyze each disease in isolation, missing the complex interplay between conditions and genetic factors. Here, we present $\aladyn$, a dynamic Bayesian framework that integrates longitudinal health records with genetic data to identify latent disease signatures while modeling individual-specific trajectories. Applied in three biobanks with up to 52 years of follow-up, our model discovers clinically interpretable disease signatures that show remarkable cross-population consistency (median 80\% composition preservation) and reveal distinct biological subtypes within traditional diagnostic categories, with large effect sizes for signature differences between patient clusters (Cohen's $d$ up to 4.25, $p \leq 1\times 10^{-8}$ for 95\% of comparisons). Genetic validation demonstrates biological relevance through multiple complementary approaches: enrichment in known risk populations (familial hypercholesterolemia carriers, clonal hematopoiesis carriers), 151 genome-wide significant loci including novel cardiovascular associations in our dataset, rare variant associations with established disease genes (\textit{LDLR}, \textit{TTN}, \textit{BRCA2}), and heritability exceeding component diseases. We also include a non-specific low-incidence signature which captures resistance across many disease conditions. The model's explicit likelihood formulation enables principled corrections for selection bias through inverse probability weighting while preserving biological signal. For clinical prediction, $\aladyn$ substantially outperforms established risk scores (PCE, PREVENT, GAIL) across 28 conditions over both 1-year and 10-year horizons. By jointly modeling genetics and longitudinal diagnoses, $\aladyn$ achieves enhanced biological discovery and improved disease prediction through a unified, interpretable framework.

\section*{Introduction}

% The first paragraph does NOT have a heading
\noindent

The risk of disease varies substantially between individuals and throughout life, with complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and accumulated comorbidities. Understanding these dynamic risk patterns could transform early detection, prevention, and personalized treatment strategies \cite{berry_bayesian_2006,bellot_flexible_2020,angus_heterogeneity_2021}. The increasing availability of large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) linked to genetic data provides unprecedented opportunities to model these complex disease trajectories at a population scale \cite{sudlow_uk_2015,pedersen_adult_2023,urbut_msgene_2024}. However, extracting meaningful patterns from these rich, longitudinal datasets remains challenging due to patient population heterogeneity, the temporal nature of disease progression, and intricate relationships between diverse conditions.

Traditional approaches to analyzing EHR data often focus on isolated diseases or simple pairwise associations, failing to capture how multiple conditions evolve together over time (\cite{zhao_using_2019}). 
Recent unsupervised methods have attempted to identify disease clusters or trajectories \cite{jiang_age-dependent_2023}, but typically do not account for temporal dynamics of disease risk, biological variability underlying the same disease, or the influence of genetic factors on disease progression \cite{urbut_dynamic_2023, hyttinen_genetic_2003}. %Furthermore, many models assume conditional independence of diseases, missing the opportunity to leverage information across related conditions for both prediction and discovery \cite{blei_dynamic_2006, blei_latent_2003}. 
Consider a patient who develops rheumatoid arthritis at age 45, followed by hypertension at 48, and eventually suffers a myocardial infarction at 52. Traditional approaches may treat these as separate events or simple comorbidities, missing the underlying metabolic-inflammatory process that drives this progression. In addition, they typically do not use information from patients with similar patterns to improve prediction for rare diseases, where limited data make traditional disease-specific models less reliable.

We present $\aladyn$, a generative model that integrates germline genetic data with longitudinal EHRs to identify latent disease signatures to model individual-specific health trajectories over time.  $\aladyn$ addresses these limitations by identifying shared disease signatures that capture biological processes common across multiple conditions, enabling more accurate prediction even for rare diseases through information sharing with related, more common conditions. Our approach offers several key advantages over existing methods: (1) \textbf{Interpretability}: it generates disease signatures which are not only computational representations, but correspond also to clinically meaningful biological processes; (2) \textbf{Temporal modeling}: it captures how disease risk evolves dynamically over the life course; (3) \textbf{Genetic integration}: it directly and interpretably incorporates genetic information into the model architecture; (4) \textbf{Unified framework}: it simultaneously models the majority of prevalent conditions in the EHR, sharing information across related conditions, and improving prediction even for diseases with limited data \cite{caruana_multitask_1997}; (5) \textbf{Individual-specific trajectories}: it provides personalized risk profiles that adapt as new clinical information becomes available; and (6) \textbf{Principled bias adjustment}: is grounded in an explicit likelihood specification, supporting principled adjustment for selection bias through inverse probability weighting.
%the separation of biological disease-signature relationships from population composition effects enables principled correction for selection bias through inverse probability weighting, preserving core biological patterns while adapting to reweighted population distributions. 
In summary, jointly modeling multiple diseases and their genetic determinants, $\aladyn$ enables both improved prediction of future disease risk and enhanced discovery of genetic architecture underlying complex phenotypes, while revealing meaningful patient subgroups with distinct biological mechanisms that could inform personalized interventions.

\subsection*{$\aladyn$ captures temporal disease signatures and individual trajectories}

Disease patterns among individuals vary by onset, progression speed, and composition, reflecting different underlying biological mechanisms. 
%Unlike allocation-based topic models that conditionally allocate observed diseases to categories \cite{jiang_age-dependent_2023, blei_dynamic_2006}, 
$\aladyn$  models the probability of each disease for an individual by integrating across multiple latent signatures (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:model_overview}}).

For each individual $i$, disease $d$, and time point $t$, $\pi_{idt}$ is the hazard of disease occurrence, that is, the probability of disease occurrence assuming the individual is still at risk for disease $d$. In $\aladyn$  this
is a weighted combination of signature-specific probabilities, where each signature captures patterns of diseases that tend to occur together (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:notation})}:
%
\begin{equation}
\pi_{idt} = \kappa \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{K} \theta_{ikt} \cdot \text{sigmoid}(\phi_{kdt}).
\label{eq:pieqn}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent Here $\text{sigmoid}(\phi_{kdt}) = 1/(1+e^{-\phi_{kdt}})$, $\kappa$ is a global calibration parameter, $\theta_{ikt}$ is individual $i$'s normalized and time-varying association with signature $k$ at time $t$, and $\phi_{kdt}$ captures the relationship between signature $k$ and disease $d$ over time $t$.
%
The normalized individual-signature associations (loadings) $\theta_{ikt}$ are derived from latent variables $\lambda_{ikt}$ through a softmax transformation:
%
\begin{equation}
\theta_{ikt} = \frac{\exp(\lambda_{ikt})}{\sum_{k'=1}^{K} \exp(\lambda_{ik't})}.
\label{eq:theta_gp}
\end{equation}
%
These latent variables $\lambda_{ikt}$ follow a Gaussian process \cite{Rasmussen2006Gaussian} prior wherein we model the effects of genetic factors and time (see \textbf{Methods; Figure~\ref{fig:training_architecture}}). Specifically:
%
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{ik} \sim \mathcal{GP}(r_k + \mathbf{g}_i^{\top}\Gamma_k, \Omega_{\lambda})
\label{eq:lambda_gp}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $r_k$ is a signature-specific reference level in the population, $\Gamma_k$ captures genetic effects on signature predisposition, $\mathbf{g}_i$ represents individual genetic and demographic factors (36 polygenic risk scores, sex, and 10 genetic principal components; 47 features total) affecting the mean of $\lambda_{ik}$, and $\Omega_{\lambda}$ is a temporal covariance kernel modeling smooth trajectories for $\lambda_{ikt}$ over time.

Similarly, the disease-signature associations follow a Gaussian process prior:
%
\begin{equation}
\phi_{kd} \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu_d + \psi_{kd}, \Omega_{\phi})
\label{eq:phi_gp}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\mu_d$ is a disease-specific baseline, or the logit of the population prevalence, $\psi_{kd}$ represents the overall strength of association between signature $k$ and disease $d$, and $\Omega_{\phi}$ allows for temporal variation in these associations. Neatly, $\Omega_{\phi}$ and $\Omega_{\lambda}$ govern the temporal covariance of deviations from the mean trajectory and are by construction independent from the mean.  By specifying Gaussian process priors as offsets of mean parameters, our model encourages temporal fluctuations to be  distinct from systematic effects like genetic predisposition or disease-signature associations. 
%This structure is standard in Gaussian process models and allows to distinguish between stable individual differences and time-varying dynamics without confounding.

A key innovation of our approach lies in its formulation as a mixture of probabilities rather than a probability of a mixture, as in traditional sparse factor analysis approaches \cite{wang_empirical_2021}. We also differ from allocation-based topic models that conditionally assign diseases to individuals $\textit{after}$ the event has necessarily occurred \cite{jiang_age-dependent_2023}. In contrast $\aladyn$ directly models the probability of disease occurrence as a weighted combination of signature-specific disease probabilities.

This crucial distinction allows our model to: (1) predict future disease onset rather than merely explain observed diagnoses; (2) accommodate multiple contributing disease processes simultaneously rather than forcing competitive allocation to a single signature; and (3) accurately model chronic conditions that persist over time rather than treating each diagnosis as an independent event. The combination of softmax-transformed individual loadings ($\theta$) and sigmoid-transformed disease probabilities ($\phi$) ensures proper probability scaling. Importantly, given the signature loadings $\theta_{ikt}$ and associations $\phi_{kdt}$, diseases are conditionally independent—all disease correlations are mediated through shared signatures.

\textbf{Terminology clarification:} The factor analysis literature exhibits inconsistent terminology that can be confusing. In some traditions (e.g., sparse factor analysis \cite{wang_empirical_2021, engelhardt_analysis_2010}), ``loadings" refer to individual-specific weights (our $\lambda$ parameters), while ``factors" or ``coefficients" refer to feature importance (our $\phi$ parameters). In other traditions, ``loadings" refer to feature importance (our $\phi$ parameters), while individual components are called ``scores" or ``weights" (our $\lambda$ parameters). Throughout this work, we use "loadings" to refer to individual-specific signature associations ($\lambda$ and $\theta$) and "signature-disease associations" to refer to feature importance ($\phi$), consistent with the sparse factor analysis convention.% where loadings represent individual variation and factors represent feature structure.

\textbf{Two complementary applications:} $\aladyn$ serves two distinct but complementary purposes, each requiring different analytical approaches. For biomedical discovery, $\aladyn$ operates with complete hindsight, leveraging entire patient trajectories to maximize our ability to identify biological patterns and mechanisms. This retrospective analysis transforms our understanding of disease patterns, progression speed, genetic relationships, and disease associations by using all available longitudinal data to characterize disease signatures, quantify genetic influences, and reveal patient heterogeneity within diagnostic categories. For clinical prediction, we operate under strict temporal constraints that mirror real-world clinical decision making (see \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:training_architecture}} for distinction). We employ a rigorous temporal validation framework that uses only information available up to a prediction time point (see \textbf{Figure ~\ref{fig:recruitment_timeline}}). This prospective approach reflects real-world clinical use, where physicians must predict future risk based solely on a patient's history to date, and ensures our performance metrics reflect true predictive capability rather than retrospective explanation. This is consistent with a well-established body of work on validation and clinical use of risk stratification (~\cite{steyerberg_towards_2014}, landmarking approaches ~\cite{Putter2017UnderstandingLA} and survival analysis~\cite{cox_regression_1972}). 

\subsection*{Applying $\aladyn$ identifies consistent signature patterns across diverse populations}

We applied $\aladyn$ to three independent biobank: UK Biobank (UKB, n=427,239), Mass General Brigham (MGB, n=48,069), and All of Us (AoU, n=208,263) (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:baseline_characteristics}, Figure~\ref{fig:cohort_design}}). We obtained ICD-10 codes from hospitalization diagnoses in each \cite{sudlow_uk_2015, koyama_decoding_2023} and transformed these to pheCodes \cite{bastarache_using_2021}, following established approaches for EHR phenotyping \cite{hripcsak_next-generation_2013} (see \textbf{Methods}). A set of 348 pheCodes were selected representing diseases with at least 1000 unique occurrences in UK Biobank hospitalization episode statistics \cite{yeung_ukbpheno_2022} as in \cite{jiang_age-dependent_2023}. These same pheCodes were also present in AoU and MGB(see \textbf{Methods}). 
Despite differences in population characteristics, healthcare systems, and data collection methodologies across these cohorts, our model identified remarkably consistent signature patterns (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:signature_summary_actual}; Figures~\ref{fig:cluster_correspondence}, \ref{fig:temporal_ukb}, \ref{fig:temporal_aou}, \ref{fig:temporal_mgb}}).

We set the number of signatures for training to $K=21$ comprising 20 disease signature and one health signature. The signatures we estimated are stable both across cohorts and across data subsets (batches) within a cohort  (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:phi_batch}}). They capture distinct and recognizable disease processes including cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, and oncologic conditions (see \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:signature_summary_actual}} for full characterization). Each signature demonstrates characteristic temporal patterns, with disease probabilities evolving dynamically with age. These are stable across biobanks (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}A; Figures~\ref{fig:temporal_ukb}, \ref{fig:temporal_aou}, \ref{fig:temporal_mgb}}). For example, the non-ischemic cardiovascular signature shows steadily increasing probabilities for conditions like atrial fibrillation and heart failure after age 55 years, while the malignancy signature displays a sharp rise in metastatic disease probabilities between ages 60-75 years. The $\psi_{kd}$ capture the strength of association between diseases and signatures and vary within signatures in a way that is empirically determined during training (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}B}). The model also captures clinically expected temporal disease progression: hypercholesterolemia precedes myocardial infarction within the ischemic cardiovascular signature, while primary malignancies precede metastatic disease within the cancer signature (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}E}). These nuanced temporal relationships emerge directly from the model without explicit encoding, demonstrating $\aladyn$'s ability to learn clinically meaningful disease trajectories. 

The average age-specific hazard for a wide range of diseases are visualized in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}C}, highlighting temporal risk patterns. Furthermore, the model's tensor structure (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:data-description}}), enables rapid disease hazard calculation using the average loadings (\textbf{Equation~\ref{eq:lambda_gp}}) and population-level $\phi_{kd}$.

These signature patterns show strong consistency across the three independent biobanks (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}D; Figures~\ref{fig:temporal_ukb}, \ref{fig:temporal_aou}, \ref{fig:temporal_mgb}}). For example, when comparing the membership of diseases within signatures between any two biobanks (with disease-to-signature assignments determined by posterior fitting using the signature with maximum posterior association strength, $\text{argmax}_k(\psi_{kd})$), we observed high concordance (median composition preservation probability index = 0.80, IQR = 0.667, 0.964) across all pairwise comparisons between biobanks, \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_correspondence}}). \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}E} illustrates this consistency for two important signatures: cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Despite differences in healthcare system and coding practices, the temporal patterns of key diseases within these signatures remain remarkably consistent, supporting the biological validity of the patterns discovered. 

\subsection*{Personalized trajectories reveal heterogeneity within disease categories}
Beyond population-level signatures, $\aladyn$ provides individual-specific trajectory information through the time-varying $\lambda_{ikt}$ parameters that reveal distinct disease progression patterns. 

\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:individual_trajectories}A} illustrates how individual disease journeys reveal biological differences among patients sharing the same diagnosis, reflecting heterogeneity—i.e., the presence of distinct subgroups with different underlying disease signature distributions—within the diagnostic category. This example patient (Patient Encoded Identifier 148745) demonstrates a complex trajectory with multiple diseases across diverse signatures. The figure shows the patient's signature loadings ($\theta$) over time, their disease timeline, and the time-varying disease probabilities ($\pi$) for diagnosed conditions, demonstrating how $\aladyn$ integrates multiple data types to provide a comprehensive view of disease progression.  Additional examples (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:patient_trajectories}}) demonstrate the diversity in temporal loadings that would be missed by an approach that considered only average loading. Our model also illustrates how individual-level trajectories and population phenomena combine to produce time-varying personalized disease probabilities (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:contribution}}): overall risk can be decomposed into the contributions of an individual's time-varying population level signature loadings, demonstrating the complex interplay between multiple signatures in determining disease risk. 

Aggregating these individual patterns reveals distinct group-level differences. In a retrospective analysis, the comparison of early-onset ($\leq$ 55 years, mean age of event 49.9 years) and late-onset ($\geq$ 70 years, mean age of onset 74.6 years) MI in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:individual_trajectories}B} shows that early-onset patients exhibit a higher and earlier peak in their Signature 5 contribution, as well as a more rapid increase in signature loading prior to the event, compared to late-onset cases. These quantitative differences in trajectory characteristics suggest that early- and late-onset MI, while sharing the same clinical diagnosis, may result from distinct disease processes requiring different preventive strategies.

To intuitively illustrate differences in signature composition among patients with the same clinical diagnosis for three representative diseases (myocardial infarction, breast cancer, and major depressive disorder), we applied a descriptive k-means clustering to patients' time-averaged signature loadings for each disease (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:individual_trajectories}C}). This two-step approach first identifies patient subgroups based on their average signature associations, then visualizes temporal deviations from population reference trajectories for each cluster, providing clinically interpretable patient stratification. A complementary deviation-based clustering approach confirmed these patterns across biobanks (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:pathway_heterogeneity}}).

\newcommand{\Ccsig}{$C_{ck}^{\mbox{\small SIG}}$ }
We then calculated cluster-specific Cohen's effect sizes\cite{cohen_statistical_2013} \Ccsig as follows (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:cohen_d}; Extended Data)}. For cluster $c$ and  signature $k$, \Ccsig is the standardized difference in mean time-averaged signature loadings between individuals in cluster $c$ and those in all other clusters (see \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:cohen_d}}). This is a measure of how distinct each cluster is with regard to each disease signature.

This analysis revealed that the majority of signature differences between clusters were not only large in magnitude (with many \Ccsig values exceeding 0.8, and some as high as 2.5–4.2), but also highly statistically significant (p $\leq 1\times$10$^{-8}$ for nearly all clusters). The largest effect size occurs in major depressive disorder, for the pain/inflammatory/metabolic signature 7 (characterized by asthma, migraine, osteoporosis, depression, and obesity) in cluster 1, which showed $C_{1,7}^{\mbox{\small SIG}} = 2.76$ (p $\approx$ 0), revealing a depression subgroup with strong inflammatory comorbidities. In myocardial infarction, signature 5 (encompassing coronary atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and hypercholesterolemia) shows $C_{2,5}^{\mbox{\small SIG}} = 2.82$ (p $\approx$ 0) in cluster 2, indicating substantial heterogeneity between patient subgroups. In breast cancer, the gynecologic signature 8 shows the strongest differentiation ($C_{1,8}^{\mbox{\small SIG}}$ = 4.25, p $\approx$ 0), while the pain/inflammatory/metabolic signature (Signature 7) achieved near-complete patient separation in breast cancer cluster 2 ($C_{2,7}^{\mbox{\small SIG}}$ = 2.53, p $\approx$ 0). 

\newcommand{\Ccprs}{$C_{cp}^{\mbox{\small PRS}}$}
We quantified PRS variability across patient clusters using Cohen's effect sizes \Ccprs, revealing substantial differences in polygenic risk scores between patient subgroups that parallel the biological variation observed in signature loadings (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:genetics}B; Extended Data}). These clusters show elevated disease-specific PRS patterns (e.g., cardiovascular PRS enrichment in myocardial infarction clusters), confirming the biological meaningfulness of the identified patient subgroups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the observed heterogeneity is both quantitatively substantial and statistically robust, supporting the biological relevance of the patient subgroups we identified (see \textbf{Extended Data S1-S3}).

\subsection*{Integration of ancestry differences and selection biases}

We also investigated how genetic ancestry influences signature loadings across the life course, revealing that ancestry-specific signature enrichment patterns vary with age (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:population_stratification}}). Genetic ancestry is now explicitly modeled through principal components (PCs) of genotype matrix. For South Asian ancestry, cardiovascular Signature 5 shows strong enrichment that peaks around ages 50-60 (deviation ~0.025-0.03 when PCs are excluded), and the effect of ancestry is larger when PCs are included (peak deviation ~0.06 at age 60, remaining elevated at ~0.04 by age 80). East Asian ancestry shows enrichment in Signature 8 and Signature 9, with patterns that become more pronounced when PCs are included. These temporal patterns demonstrate that ancestry effects on signatures evolve across the life course, with peak deviations occurring at different life stages for different ancestries.

\subsection*{Genetic factors influence signature trajectories}
%% confirm BH test
A key innovation of $\aladyn$ is its integration of genetic information directly into the model through the $\Gamma_k$ parameters, which capture how polygenic risk scores (PRS) influence signature loadings. Using a comprehensive collection of 36 externally validated PRS developed independently of our signature analysis \cite{thompson_uk_2022}, we identified 116 significant PRS-signature association coefficients out of 756 candidate combinations (FDR $<$ 0.05 using Benjamini-Hochberg correction on two-sided posterior tail probabilities) (\textbf{Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:gamma_z}}; see Extended Data S0). We observed the strongest genetic effects for signatures with known heritable components: coronary artery disease PRS with the cardiovascular signature (Signature 5, $\gamma = 0.153$, Z = 27.2, p $<$ $10^{-15}$), LDL cholesterol PRS with Signature 5 ($\gamma = 0.071$, Z = 22.7, p $<$ $10^{-15}$), and type 2 diabetes PRS with the metabolic signature (Signature 15, $\gamma = 0.154$, Z = 58.3, p $<$ $10^{-15}$).  Highly significant Z statistics (Extended data $Annotation/gamma_associations.csv$) demonstrate that genetic factors directly influence disease signature trajectories, consistent with the high heritability of these disease categories.

For the two genetic association analyses that follow, we trained a modified model to systematically identify genetic loci associated with signature trajectories. We defined a phenotype of 'lifetime signature exposure' for each signature, computed as the area under each individual's signature loading curve over their follow-up period (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:aex_calculation}; Methods}). Crucially, to avoid circularity, we removed the PRS term ($\mathbf{g}_i^{\top}\Gamma_k$ in Equation 3) from the prior on $\lambda$ and re-trained signature loadings. We performed common variants genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) on the 'lifetime signature exposure' phenotype, testing 6,418,439 imputed variants (MAF $\geq$ 0.01, INFO $\geq$ 0.7) that passed quality control (\textbf{Methods}).

Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) \cite{bulik-sullivan_ld_2015} on 930,186 variants with available LD scores revealed significant SNP-based heritability for multiple signatures (Table~\ref{tab:ldsc_results}), with the strongest signal observed for the cardiovascular signature ($h^{2}$ = 0.0414, SE = 0.003), followed by musculoskeletal ($h^{2}$ = 0.035, SE = 0.002) and pain/inflammation signatures ($h^{2}$ = 0.027, SE = 0.002). Critically, because our signature phenotypes are \emph{continuous} (integrated area under the signature loading curve), heritability is inherently reported on the observed scale---there is no liability-scale transformation. For valid comparison with reported results, we therefore computed observed-scale heritability for component binary traits using the same LDSC procedure on the same UK Biobank data; signature heritability met or exceeded that of constituent traits on this comparable scale (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:component_cvd_heritabilities_liability}}).

%% remove p values
Common variant GWAS identified 151 genome-wide significant loci across our 21 signature GWAS, with the cardiovascular signature (Signature 5) alone accounting for 56 lead loci. The strongest associations revealed signature-specific genetic architectures: Signature 5 showed strong signals at LPA (rs10455872), APOE (rs7412), and PCSK9 (rs11591147), all established lipid metabolism genes \cite{willer_discovery_2013, kathiresan_genetics_2008}. The metabolic/diabetes signature identified TCF7L2 (rs7903146), the strongest known type 2 diabetes risk variant \cite{grant_variant_2006}, while the musculoskeletal signature identified GDF5 (rs143384), a well-established osteoarthritis gene \cite{evans_meta-analysis_2011}, the ophthalmologic signature (Signature 10) captured HTRA1 and CFH, key age-related macular degeneration gene; while the hepatobiliary signature (Signature 18) showed the strongest overall signal at ABCG8 (rs11887534), a gallstone risk gene, while also revealing additional loci warranting further investigation. Cross-signature connections also  revealed shared genetic architecture: APOE appeared in both the cardiovascular signature (Signature 5) and the infectious/critical care signature (Signature 16), reflecting its dual role in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease risk (Extended Data GWAS). 

We found that 23 of Signature 5's 56 annotated loci were not found as lead loci in our own single-trait constituent cardiovascular GWAS using exact lead-SNP matching, including associations near genes with established roles in cardiovascular disease \cite{tcheandjieu_large-scale_2022} (\textit{IL6R} (rs6687726), \textit{SCARB1} (rs11057839), \textit{SMAD3} (rs56375023), \textit{PDGFD} (rs1384705), and others) (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:sig5_unique_loci}}, Extended Data). Using $\pm$1MB window overlap instead of exact lead-SNP matching, 10 of the 56 Signature 5 lead loci have no constituent-trait lead locus within $\pm$1MB in our analyses. Importantly, within our study and analysis pipeline applied to the same UK Biobank data, joint multi-disease signature modeling enables detection of associations that were not detected as lead loci in the corresponding single-trait constituent GWAS (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, acute IHD, chronic IHD), consistent with distributed pleiotropic effects that are too weak to detect individually in our sample but become detectable when aggregated across related phenotypes. While some of these loci (e.g., \textit{IL6R}) have been identified in large-scale external CAD GWAS meta-analyses, they were not detected in our single-trait analyses, demonstrating that signature-based modeling enhances discovery power even within the same dataset. Among these, loci annotated to \textit{WWP2}, \textit{C1S}, \textit{HYOU1}, \textit{EHBP1}, \textit{R3HDM2}, and \textit{OPRL1/LKAAEAR1} (and \textit{ARMS2}) appear among the more plausible candidates for follow-up given more limited prior evidence as CAD loci. Accordingly, when associating significant loci in each signature with component trait genotype dosage, we found similar improvements across signatures (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:snp_phenotype}}), supporting that our latent signatures reproduce constituent-trait associations and in many cases identify additional variants, demonstrating enhanced genetic discovery power of latent signatures.

We also performed gene-based rare variant association studies (RVAS) using aggregated rare variants within genes, testing whether gene-level rare variant burden is associated with signature exposure. This analysis tested 18,464 genes per signature using REGENIE gene-based association tests with loss-of-function and deleterious missense variants (Mask3: LoF, DelMis09, DelMis08), identifying 18 unique genes with genome-wide significant associations (p $<$ $2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ after Bonferroni correction) across 21 signatures. The ischemic cardiovascular signature (Signature 5) demonstrated association with four significant genes after false discovery correction - \textit{LDLR}, \textit{APOB}, \textit{LPA} and \textit{CDH26} - all with established roles in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease \cite{abifadel_mutations_2003, benn_genetic_2008}. Signature 0 (heart failure/arrhythmia) showed a highly significant association with \textit{TTN} (p = $1.0\times 10^{-21}$), encoding the cardiac structural protein titin \cite{herman_truncations_2012}, while Signatures 16 (critical illness/inflammation) was associated with \textit{TET2}, \textit{PKD1}, and \textit{BRCA2} (Extended data, RVAS; \ref{tab:rvas_mask3}). \textit{TET2} is highly relevant to this signature's component diseases (sepsis, infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemias), as \textit{TET2} mutations cause clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which is associated with chronic inflammation, increased infection risk, and blood cell dysfunction \cite{jaiswal_age-related_2014}. \textit{PKD1} mutations relate to kidney dysfunction and could contribute to acute renal failure and electrolyte disorders that characterize this signature \cite{harris_autosomal_2011}. The ophthalmologic signature (Signature 10) was associated with \textit{MIP}, encoding major intrinsic protein of lens fiber, which is essential for lens transparency and cataract formation \cite{shiels1996mutations}, validating the signature's capture of age-related eye disease pathways.
These rare variant associations were robust across multiple variant masks (tested across six progressively inclusive functional impact categories) (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:rvas_detailed}C}; supplementary data). Finally, for each signature-gene pair identified through RVAS, we computed correlations between rare variant burden and disease presence across all diseases. We then plotted gene-disease correlations (x-axis) against the corresponding disease-signature loadings (y-axis) for diseases with statistically significant gene-disease correlations (p $<$ 0.05). The y-axis displays the maximum signature-disease association over time ($\max_t \phi_{kdt}$) transformed via sigmoid to probability scale, representing peak signature-disease association. We computed the correlation between these two vectors (\ref{fig:threeeway}). 

To further demonstrate the biological relevance of our signatures, we examined signature enrichment in specific high-risk populations with known genetic predispositions (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:fh_chip_validation}}). For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is caused by mutations in LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9, leading to severely elevated LDL cholesterol and premature cardiovascular disease \cite{nordestgaard_familial_2013}, making FH carriers an ideal validation population for cardiovascular signature enrichment. We compared the proportion of FH carriers versus non-carriers who showed a pre-event rise in cardiovascular Signature 5 loadings (defined as an increase over the 5 years preceding their first cardiovascular event). FH carriers showed significantly higher rates of pre-event Signature 5 activation compared to non-carriers (odds ratio = 1.63, Fisher's exact test p = 0.017), providing evidence that Signature 5 captures cardiovascular risk pathways. 

We also validated signature associations using clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) carriers, demonstrating enrichments that provide independent support for the biological interpretability of signatures. CHIP mutations cause chronic inflammation and are associated with increased risk of hematologic malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and other inflammatory conditions \cite{jaiswal_clonal_2019}. Our analysis reveals that CHIP carriers show strong enrichment in Signature 16 (Critical Care/Inflammation) before multiple outcomes: DNMT3A carriers show 1.97-fold enrichment (OR=1.97, p=0.0007) for Signature 16 before Leukemia/MDS events, with 81.1\% of carriers showing rising trajectories compared to 68.5\% of non-carriers (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:fh_chip_validation}B}). TET2 carriers similarly showed enrichment in Signature 16 before cardiovascular and inflammatory outcomes, consistent with CHIP's known association with chronic inflammation and increased cardiovascular risk \cite{jaiswal_clonal_2019}.

\textbf{Inverse probability weighting enables principled bias correction:} As the UK Biobank may be enriched in healthy individuals (\cite{schoeler_impact_2025}), we assessed the impact of such potential bias on the model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). A key advantage of $\aladyn$'s model structure is its ability to adjust for this selection bias by weighting individual terms of the likelihood function inversely to their probability of participation. This preserves interpretation of all model components, including biological disease-signature relationships—a capability that distinguishes our approach from black-box machine learning methods that cannot easily incorporate such principled corrections.

We validated IPW through two complementary approaches. First, we performed a controlled experiment by artificially creating a biased population, randomly dropping 90\% of women from the full UK Biobank sample (reducing the sample from 400,000 to 204,287 individuals, with women comprising only 10.6\% instead of 54.4\%). To isolate the effect of selection bias on parameter estimation, we retrained all model parameters ($\phi$, $\lambda$, $\gamma$, $\psi$) while holding $\mu_d$ fixed across all three scenarios (full cohort, biased cohort without IPW, and biased cohort with IPW). We successfully recovered the full population patterns using IPW: signature-disease associations ($\phi$) remained stable, while disease probabilities ($\pi$) and \textit{empirical prevalence} trajectories (observed disease rates calculated from the data, not the model parameter $\mu_d$) for diseases with expected sex bias (e.g., Breast and Prostate cancer) matched those trained in the full population (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:ipw_analysis}}).

Second, we applied IPW to correct for real-world UK Biobank participation bias using a published\cite{10.1093/ije/dyae054} lasso-regularized logistic regression model trained on demographic variables (region, birth year, sex, household characteristics, employment status, tenure, ethnicity, self-reported health, and education) to estimate probabilities of UK Biobank participation. We calculated weights as the ratio of the general population selection rate (4.34\%) to each individual's predicted selection probability, trimming at the 1st and 99th percentiles (weight range: 0.17-6.63, mean: 0.93, median: 0.59). These weights were incorporated into the \aladyn{} likelihood function by multiplying each individual's contribution by their IPW (Eqn.~\ref{eq:ipw_loss}), with cross-biobank validation across UK Biobank, Mass General Brigham, and All of Us demonstrating that signature patterns remain consistent across selection mechanisms.

In both validation experiments, the signature-disease associations ($\phi$) remain stable (correlation $>$ 0.999, mean absolute difference $<$ 0.002), demonstrating that core biological patterns are preserved, while individual loadings ($\lambda$) adapt to reflect the reweighted population distribution. This structural separation enables principled bias correction while maintaining interpretability.

\subsection*{Dynamic risk assessment improves disease prediction}

A primary motivation for modeling longitudinal disease patterns is to improve prediction of future disease events. To rigorously evaluate $\aladyn$'s predictive performance, we implemented comprehensive, leakage-free validation strategies that mimic real-world clinical follow-up (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:prediction_methods}}). 

\textbf{Primary evaluation: Dynamic 1-year predictions.} Our primary evaluation uses a temporal validation approach (evaluating predictions at multiple fixed timepoints) \cite{Putter2017UnderstandingLA}, where we compute 1-year risk predictions at 10 distinct time points during follow-up (enrollment + 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 years). At each time point, we retrain models using only data available up to that point and evaluate performance on 1-year outcomes. We report the median AUC across these 10 dynamic 1-year predictions, which captures how predictive accuracy evolves as patients accumulate new diagnoses over time and reflects how the model would be used in clinical practice. 

All individuals contribute EHR data from age 30+ onwards (or first EHR access), providing decades of longitudinal disease history. Individuals enrolled in UK Biobank between 2006-2010 at ages 40-70 years (median age 54, see \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment_timeline}}) and were followed for a median of 14.4 years until 2023/2024 (see \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:exit_entry_ages}}). 

%For this prediction analysis, we refit models at enrollment + 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 years and calculate 1-year AUCs at each timepoint, reporting the median across these 10 predictions to ensure consistent evaluation across all participants. This approach leverages the full disease trajectory from early adulthood while maintaining standardized follow-up periods. 
All predictions were generated using leave-one-out cross-validation (excluding each batch from training when generating its predictions) to ensure robust, generalizable performance estimates. This primary evaluation demonstrates robust performance across diseases (ASCVD: 0.879, Breast Cancer: 0.867, Atrial Fibrillation: 0.801, Heart Failure: 0.811, Parkinson's: 0.796, \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:aladynoulli_performance}}).

\textbf{Comparison with existing benchmarks: 1-year and 10-year predictions.}
For comparison with traditional clinical risk scores, we also evaluated predictions made at recruitment (using models trained with data up to enrollment) against both 1-year and 10-year outcomes (\aladyn{} 1-year, 10-year). This comparison between \aladyn{} and traditional risk scores is only feasible at enrollment (i.e., 2006-2010 in UKB, \textbf{Fig~\ref{fig:recruitment_timeline}}) because of availability of the necessary input. At enrollment, 1-year predictions show good performance (ASCVD: 0.881, Breast Cancer: 0.782, Atrial Fibrillation: 0.797, Heart Failure: 0.769). 10-year predictions, as expected, are less precise, but we  maintain predictive power (ASCVD: 0.733, All Cancers: 0.674, Diabetes: 0.651, \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:aladynoulli_performance}}). It is important to note that for the vast majority of the 348 conditions considered, there is no established lifetime risk model in current clinical practice. All analyses were performed strictly prospectively, ensuring that only data available up to prediction time was used for each individual predicted. Individuals with prevalent disease at prediction time were excluded (see \textbf{Methods}).

We also evaluated a dynamic 10-year rolling interpolation approach that demonstrates the model's capabilities with time-dependent information: by updating predictions annually and aggregating risk over a 10-year horizon (similar to time-dependent covariates, \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:rolling_interpolation}}), this approach shows how the model's probability estimates evolve as new information becomes available. Note that this approach uses information at each year and is therefore not directly comparable to standard prediction evaluations, but provides insight into how model performance improves when incorporating time-dependent covariates (see \textbf{Extended Methods; Table~\ref{tab:prediction_methods}}). Finally, we compared with traditional cox modeling \cite{cox_regression_1972} using age as a time scale, also on ten-year outcomes, using sex and family history when available as a predictor.

Comprehensive calibration analysis demonstrates calibration across the full range of predicted risks (MSE = $4.67 \times 10^{-7}$), with mean predicted rates ($5.55 \times 10^{-4}$) closely matching mean observed rates ($5.45 \times 10^{-4}$) across 722,346,330 patient-time observations (at-risk only) (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:performance}D}). The calibration plots show alignment between predicted and observed rates.

We further evaluated $\aladyn$'s performance for ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk prediction, first in the general population (\textbf{Fig~\ref{fig:one_year_vsPCE}}) and then in specific high-risk subgroups. In the overall cohort, $\aladyn$ outperformed both PREVENT (AUC: 0.667) and PCE (AUC: 0.683) (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:performance}D}), with performance in sex-based analyses (males: $\aladyn$ 0.711 vs PREVENT 0.615; females: $\aladyn$ 0.710 vs PREVENT 0.665, \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:roc_prevent}}). We also evaluated the GAIL model \cite{gail_projecting_1989} for breast cancer, using the reported family history data for comparison in the UKB. Of note, many disease-specific clinical scores require information not available on biobank level interviews, though the UK Biobank did provide these variables. $\aladyn$ compared to the GAIL model showed 1-year AUCs of 0.782 vs 0.549 (difference +0.233) for women only (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:external_scores}}).

We then specifically evaluated $\aladyn$'s performance in patients with pre-existing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and breast cancer (BC) for 10-year ASCVD risk prediction. This analysis investigates whether $\aladyn$ maintains predictive accuracy in the presence of confounding comorbidities that can mask cardiovascular risk signals, a common challenge in clinical practice. For 10-year ASCVD outcomes, we used the static version of our leakage-free prediction approach to compute baseline risk for each individual, as the number of ASCVD events per year in these high-risk subgroups was too small to allow stable estimation of dynamic 1-year AUCs (see Methods). $\aladyn$ achieved AUCs of 0.694 (RA) and 0.689 (BC) for 10-year ASCVD prediction in these high-risk subgroups, outperforming PREVENT (RA: 0.659, BC: 0.544) in these high risk populations where traditional models often underperform, portrayed also in distinct signature trajectories (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:RAsig}}).

\textbf{Temporal leakage assessment:}
We conducted three sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our predictions to temporal misalignment and diagnostic cascades.

\textbf{(1) Reverse causation assessment:} We excluded events occurring within 1, 3, or 6 months before enrollment from predictions at enrollment. This investigates whether predictions rely on diagnostic cascades immediately preceding enrollment rather than genuine predictive signals. Performance remained essentially unchanged across both time horizons: for ASCVD, 1-year prediction AUC was 0.870 at baseline and 0.862 with 6-month exclusion (drop of 0.9\%); 10-year prediction AUC was 0.726 at baseline and 0.726 with 6-month exclusion (no measurable drop). The negligible impact of excluding pre-enrollment events indicates that diagnostic cascades are not driving our predictions (see extended data Washout horizons; main text Figure~\ref{fig:performance}d).

\textbf{(2) Time horizon analysis:} We compared 10-year predictions at enrollment with and without excluding the first year of outcomes from evaluation. This demonstrated substantial residual predictive power after removing early events that could reflect diagnostic workup effects (ASCVD AUC = 0.723 with 1-year exclusion vs 0.733 baseline, a drop of only 1.4\%; see extended data Washout horizons).

\textbf{(3) Washout period analysis across timepoints:} We evaluated 1-year predictions at fixed timepoints (enrollment+1 through enrollment+9 years) with varying washout periods (0, 1, or 2 years). At each timepoint, models were trained using only data available up to the prediction time minus the washout period, providing a comprehensive assessment of washout effects across the full follow-up window (see extended data Washout Pivot and Figure~\ref{fig:washout_analysis}).


%For 10-year ASCVD outcomes using our dynamic 1-year scoring approach, $\aladyn$ achieved AUCs of 0.841 (RA) and 0.793 (BC), substantially outperforming both PCE (RA: 0.690, BC: 0.528) and PREVENT (RA: 0.659, BC: 0.544) (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:performance}D}). This demonstrates $\aladyn$'s ability to provide more accurate cardiovascular risk assessment in complex, high-risk populations where traditional models often underperform. Importantly, the model maintains strong predictive performance even for rarer diseases (e.g., secondary cancers, each with annual incidence $\approx$0.03\%), supporting the value of information-sharing across related conditions.

\section*{Discussion}

We presented $\aladyn$, a novel Bayesian framework for modeling dynamic disease signatures and individual health trajectories from longitudinal health records and germline genetic data. By integrating these two data modalities, $\aladyn$ provides a unified framework for understanding disease comorbidities, predicting future disease events, and discovering genetic architecture underlying complex phenotypes. This work addresses a critical gap in precision medicine \cite{ashley_towards_2016, collins_new_2015,martinez2022data}, where the integration of diverse data sources remains challenging despite the promise of personalized approaches to disease management \cite{schork_personalized_2015}. Unlike traditional disease-specific predictive models that require separate development for each condition, $\aladyn$'s unified framework simultaneously captures risk for multiple diseases, enabling information-sharing across related conditions, improved prediction for diseases with sparse data, and comprehensive decision support across clinical disciplines. Importantly, $\aladyn$ achieves this using only routinely collected diagnostic codes from standard clinical care in the EHR, without requiring the specialized laboratory values, biomarkers, or questionnaire data that established risk scores (PCE, PREVENT, GAIL) depend upon. This implies that future work combining $\aladyn$ with additional data sources can further improve its predictive ability in specific domains.
%This reliance on universally recorded diagnostic data—rather than cohort-specific measurements that may introduce selection bias or limit deployment to well-resourced settings—enables application across diverse healthcare systems where diagnostic codes are available.

Our model's identification of consistent disease signatures across three independent cohorts supports their biological validity and clinical relevance. These signatures capture meaningful disease relationships that align with known pathophysiological processes while highlighting connections between conditions that may share underlying mechanisms. The temporal dynamics of these signatures further enhance our understanding of how disease risk evolves throughout the life course, addressing the need for more sophisticated approaches to understanding disease progression beyond static risk assessment \cite{price_progress_2015}.

The genetic discovery through GWAS and RVAS analyses represents a significant advance. The identification of genetic variants that associate more strongly with signature loadings than with individual diseases demonstrates that our approach can uncover pleiotropic mechanisms with weaker effects on individual diagnoses—these may represent biologically important pathways and potential targets for therapeutic interventions that are difficult to detect with traditional single-disease GWAS approaches.

%\subsection*{Applications to precision medicine and therapeutic targeting}

Beyond risk prediction, $\aladyn$'s signature-based framework provides unique capabilities that distinguish it from traditional machine learning approaches. The interpretable, time-varying signature loadings serve as biological patient descriptors that enable fundamentally new types of analyses and applications.

\textbf{Signature-based patient matching and stratification:} Unlike black-box models that provide only risk scores, $\aladyn$'s signature loadings enable patient matching based on shared biological mechanisms rather than disease labels. Patients with similar signature profiles, even if they have different diagnoses, may share underlying pathophysiological pathways and could benefit from similar interventions. This signature-based stratification addresses a critical limitation of traditional diagnostic categories, which often mask underlying biological heterogeneity \cite{joyner_promises_2019}. For example, individuals with strong metabolic signature contributions to their coronary disease may benefit more from intensive glucose management, while those with inflammatory signature patterns might respond better to anti-inflammatory approaches, regardless of their specific cardiovascular diagnosis.

\textbf{Dynamic biological profiling:} The model's ability to detect changing signature profiles in real-time as patients accumulate new diagnoses enables dynamic adjustment of preventive strategies. \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:individual_trajectories}A--C} demonstrates this capability, showing how patients' signature loadings are updated following new clinical information, providing a continuously evolving biological profile that reflects the patient's current health state. This dynamic approach aligns with the emerging paradigm of digital medicine \cite{steinhubl_digital_2018,TYLER202017}, where continuous monitoring and real-time biological assessment enable more responsive and personalized care. Unlike machine learning approaches that require retraining to incorporate new information, $\aladyn$'s signature framework naturally updates patient descriptors as new diagnoses accumulate.

\textbf{Enhanced clinical trial design:} Signature-based patient stratification has strong potential to enhance clinical trial efficiency by identifying more homogeneous patient populations and more appropriate controls. By enrolling patients with similar signature profiles, trials might achieve greater treatment effects and identify responder subgroups more effectively. This approach could mitigate the high failure rates in clinical trials by ensuring more biologically appropriate study populations \cite{simon_adaptive_2013}, while also advancing our understanding of treatment response heterogeneity. The cross-cohort consistency we observed in signature-based patient heterogeneity further suggests that signature profiles could serve as generalizable biomarkers for patient stratification across diverse populations and healthcare settings.

Our disease-based approach fundamentally differs from approaches such as Delphi-2M (\cite{shmatko_health_2025}) and (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:delphi_comp}}) that predict individual ICD codes without aggregating to clinically meaningful disease entities. Our model predicts interpretable diseases defined through Phecode aggregation (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:phecode_aggregation}}). This principled comparison—using the same Phecode-to-ICD mappings that define our disease phenotypes—reveals that disease-level predictions provide superior clinical interpretability while maintaining competitive predictive performance. By predicting diseases rather than codes, our model enables direct clinical translation: physicians can understand and act on predictions for "myocardial infarction" or "colorectal cancer" rather than interpreting abstract ICD code probabilities that may not correspond to meaningful clinical entities. Delphi-2M model parameters are not publicly available for external validation, precluding direct model comparison or individual-level prediction replication. Our comparison is therefore based exclusively on the published performance metrics reported by Shmatko et al.~\cite{shmatko_health_2025}, using careful Phecode-to-ICD-10 mapping to ensure fair comparison between our disease-level predictions and Delphi's ICD code-level predictions. 

\textbf{Comparison with transformer-based foundation models:} In addition to differences in phenotypes, our model provides interpretable latent dimensions for both prediction and discovery of novel genetic effects without sacrificing explanatory power. Recent transformer-based foundation models for EHRs have demonstrated impressive scalability and zero-shot prediction capabilities through large-scale pre-training on EHR sequences \cite{amar2025integratinggenomicsmultimodalehr, shmatko_health_2025}. While these approaches excel at general-purpose prediction tasks, $\aladyn$ provides complementary advantages that address different clinical needs. Unlike foundation models that require extensive fine-tuning for new cohorts and lack interpretable biological structure, $\aladyn$'s signature-based framework enables fast transfer learning by fixing population-level parameters ($\phi$, $\psi$) learned from large cohorts and fitting only individual-level signature loadings ($\lambda$) for new patients—a computationally efficient approach that preserves interpretability. More importantly, $\aladyn$ uniquely combines strong predictive performance with biological discovery capabilities: the interpretable signature structure enables direct genetic discovery (151 GWAS loci, rare variant associations), biological validation (FH, CHIP enrichment), and uncertainty quantification through full Bayesian posteriors—features that foundation models' black-box architectures cannot provide. While foundation models excel at large-scale general-purpose prediction, $\aladyn$ offers a unified framework for both discovery and prediction, enabling clinicians to not only predict risk but also understand the underlying biological mechanisms driving individual trajectories, making it uniquely suited for precision medicine applications where interpretability and biological insight are paramount.

\textbf{Natural handling of competing risks:} A critical advantage of our signature-based framework is its natural accommodation of risks for 348 diseases simultaneously.  Patients  remain at risk for remaining conditions after developing one, and hazards adjust accordingly. This approach reflects clinical reality where patients can and do develop multiple serious conditions sequentially, and the model continues to provide actionable risk estimates for subsequent diseases even after initial diagnoses. For example, a patient who develops myocardial infarction at age 54 remains at risk for heart failure, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications, with the model updating their signature loadings to reflect the new clinical information while maintaining predictions for all other diseases (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:competing_risks}}).

Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our model relies on EHR data, which may contain biases related to healthcare access, diagnostic coding practices, and incomplete capture of disease history. These limitations are common to all EHR-based studies and highlight the importance of validating findings across multiple healthcare systems, as we have done here. However, a key methodological advantage of our framework is its ability to handle selection bias through inverse probability weighting: the separation of biological disease-signature relationships ($\phi$) from population composition effects ($\lambda$/$\pi$) enables principled bias correction while preserving core biological patterns, a capability that distinguishes our approach from black-box machine learning methods that cannot easily incorporate such corrections (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:ipw_analysis}}). Second, while we incorporate genetic factors, we do not explicitly model environmental exposures or lifestyle factors that significantly influence disease risk \cite{price_progress_2015}. Third, our use of established PRS may miss genetic effects that act directly on signatures but weakly on individual diagnoses, as our signature-based GWAS identified loci not captured by traditional single-disease approaches. Fourth, our model makes several important assumptions including linearity in genetic effects and additivity in signature contributions, which may not capture all complex interactions. Fifth, our model uses age (time since birth) rather than calendar year as the temporal axis, which does not explicitly capture cohort effects (changes in disease prevalence over calendar time). Because UK Biobank participants all enrolled during a narrow window (2006-2010), we are unable to explore cohort effects.
%indirectly: individuals who enrolled at different ages represent different birth cohorts (e.g., age 40 in 2006 corresponds to birth year 1966, while age 70 in 2010 corresponds to birth year 1940). Our age-stratified performance analyses (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:age_stratified_ascvd}}, \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:age_stratified_performance}}) thus provide some assessment of robustness to cohort-specific patterns, though 
Explicit modeling of calendar year trends would represents an important extension for future work. Future work could integrate these additional data sources and relax these assumptions to further enhance predictive performance and biological insight, addressing the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors that shape the risk of disease \cite{bailey_structural_2017}.

Despite these limitations, $\aladyn$ represents a significant advance in longitudinal health modeling with important implications for precision medicine \cite{ashley_towards_2016, collins_new_2015}. By capturing the complex interplay between genetic predisposition and time-varying disease patterns, our approach provides a framework for more personalized risk assessment and potential therapeutic targeting. Our model's ability to identify meaningful patient subgroups within traditional disease categories, coupled with enhanced genetic discovery power, moves beyond simple risk prediction to provide deeper insights into disease biology and patient heterogeneity. These capabilities could inform more targeted clinical trials and intervention strategies, ultimately leading to more effective personalized prevention and treatment approaches.

As healthcare increasingly moves toward data-driven precision approaches\cite{guo2024multi,steinhubl_digital_2018, schork_personalized_2015,martinez2022data}, a method like $\aladyn$ that can integrate diverse data sources and model complex temporal relationships will become increasingly valuable for improving patient outcomes. The integration of longitudinal EHR data with genetic information represents a powerful approach to understanding disease biology and improving clinical decision-making, addressing key challenges in modern medicine including the need for more accurate risk prediction, better patient stratification, and enhanced therapeutic targeting \cite{joyner_promises_2019}. This work contributes to the broader vision of precision medicine where individual biological profiles guide clinical decision-making, moving beyond the limitations of traditional diagnostic categories toward more nuanced and personalized approaches to disease management.

\subsection*{Materials and Methods}

\subsubsection*{\underline{Model}}

We recapitulate the model's formulation and provide a full account of model assumptions and implementation details. 

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Formulation}

The \aladyn{} model represents the probability of disease occurrence for patient $i$, disease $d$, at time $t$ via a mixture of probabilities as follows:
$$\pi_{idt} = \kappa \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{K} \theta_{ikt} \cdot \text{sigmoid}(\phi_{kdt}),$$
where $\kappa$ is a global calibration parameter, $\theta_{ikt}$ represents patient $i$'s time-varying association with signature $k$, and $\phi_{kdt}$ captures the relationship between signature $k$ and disease $d$ over time.

The patient-signature associations $\theta_{ikt}$ are parameterized as a softmax function of latent variables $\lambda_{ikt}$~as:
$$\theta_{ikt} = \frac{\exp(\lambda_{ikt})}{\sum_{k'=1}^{K} \exp(\lambda_{ik't})}$$

The \aladyn{} model is specified hierarchically, via distributional assumptions on many of these components, 
which we refer to as priors. 

Indicating by $\lambda_{ik}$ the function of time describing the evolution of the latent variable over time for patient $i$ and signature $k$, we specify this as a Gaussian process:
$$\lambda_{ik} \sim \mathcal{GP}(r_k + \Gamma_k^{\top}\mathbf{g}_i, \Omega_{\lambda})$$
where $r_k$ is a signature-specific baseline, $\Gamma_k$ captures how genetic/demographic factors $\mathbf{g}_i$ influence patient-signature associations, and $\Omega_{\lambda}$ is a kernel function controlling temporal smoothness. The covariate matrix $\mathbf{G}$ contains 36 polygenic risk scores plus sex and 10 genetic PCS (47 features total), providing genetic and demographic information for each individual.
%
The kernel function $\Omega_{\lambda}$ is defined as:
$$\Omega_{\lambda}(t,t') = \alpha_{\lambda}^2 \exp\left(-\frac{(t-t')^2}{2l_{\lambda}^2}\right).$$
In our implementation, the amplitude parameter $\alpha_{\lambda}$ is set to $100$ and the length-scale parameter $l_{\lambda}$ is set to~$T/4$.
%
Similarly, the disease-signature association temporal functions follow a Gaussian process:
$$\phi_{kd} \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu_d + \psi_{kd}, \Omega_{\phi}),$$
where $\mu_d$ is a disease-specific baseline derived from the logit of the population prevalence, $\psi_{kd}$ represents the the time invariant component of the association between signature $k$ and disease $d$, and $\Omega_{\phi}$ is a kernel function defined as:
$$\Omega_{\phi}(t, t') = \alpha_{\phi}^2 \exp\left(-\frac{(t-t')^2}{2l_{\phi}^2}\right),$$
where the amplitude is fixed to $\alpha_{\phi}=100$ and the length-scale is set to $l_{\phi}=T/3$ in our implementation.

The genetic effect parameters $\Gamma_k$ form a vector of length $P$ representing the effects of $P$ genetic, sex and ancestral covariates on signature $k$, and are assigned independent zero-mean Gaussian priors:
$$\Gamma_k \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2_\gamma \mathbf{I})$$
where $\sigma^2_\gamma$ is the prior variance. This prior encodes the assumption that genetic effects are expected to be small in magnitude.

\subsubsection*{Dynamic Range of Predictions}

While our mixture-of-probabilities formulation has key advantages, as described in the main text, this approach introduces technical challenges that require careful parameterization.
A key challenge with the mixture of probabilities formulation is that it naturally leads to a reduction in the variation of the predicted probabilities across individuals. When multiple sigmoid-transformed values are averaged, the resulting mixture tends to concentrate around moderate values, reducing the dynamic range of predictions. To address this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Signature-Disease Specificity ($\psi_{kd}$):} We introduce the time-independent parameters $\psi_{kd}$ above to allow each signature to have strong positive or negative associations with specific diseases. This increases the separation between signatures and ensures a realistic dynamic range of the disease probabilities within each signature.

\item \textit{Global Calibration ($\kappa$):} The global calibration parameter $\kappa$ is necessary to rescale the final probabilities to obtain realistic overall disease prevalences. In our implementation, $\kappa$ is learned from the data but in principal could be fixed.
\end{enumerate}

This balance between expressiveness (through $\psi$'s) and calibration (through $\kappa$) ensures that the model can capture both rare and common diseases accurately while maintaining interpretable signature contributions. The combination of softmax-transformed individual loadings ($\theta$) and sigmoid-transformed disease probabilities ($\phi$) with these additional parameters ensures proper probability scaling.
\end{comment}

\subsubsection*{Censored Data and Detailed E Matrix Formation Methodology}

A critical aspect of $\aladyn$ is its careful handling of censored observations, which is part of what allows it to function as a \textbf{generative model of disease progression} rather than a retrospective analysis tool. The likelihood function, defined below, incorporates time-to-event information through a standard survival analysis encoding of binary disease-specific event indicators in $Y$ and censoring times in $E$. Element $E_{id}$ in $E$ represents, in summary, the minimum of the disease-specific event time and the patient's  maximum follow-up time, ensuring the likelihood only includes timepoints where the patient was actually observed. This formulation properly accounts for competing risks by using censoring times derived from actual data. 
%Our likelihood explicitly handles censoring (lines 376-399), where $E_{id}$ represents either disease onset or censoring (including death, loss to follow-up, or end of observation).

More specifically, the matrix $E$ is defined through the following steps:

\textbf{Step 1: Identify maximum follow-up time for each patient.} For each patient $i$, we determine their maximum follow-up age from ICD-10 data: $\text{max\_censor}_i = \max(\text{last\_diagnosis\_date}_i, \text{administrative\_censor\_date}_i)$. This represents the last timepoint at which patient $i$ could have been observed, accounting for death, loss to follow-up, emigration, or end of study period.

\textbf{Step 2: Convert to timepoint scale.} We convert the maximum censoring age to the model's timepoint scale: $\text{max\_timepoint}_i = \text{max\_censor}_i - 30$, where timepoint 0 corresponds to age 30.

\textbf{Step 3: Cap event/censor times in E matrix.} For each patient $i$ and disease $d$, the $E$ matrix entry is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If disease $d$ is not observed in patient $i$, then $E_{id} = \text{max\_timepoint}_i$
\item If disease $d$ is observed in patient $i$, then $E_{id}$ is the age of the diagnosis of disease $d$ for patient $i$ in years, minus 30. 
%%\item \textbf{For censored cases} (where $E_{id}^{\text{original}} = T-1$, indicating censoring at maximum follow-up): $E_{id} = \min(E_{id}^{\text{original}}, \text{max\_timepoint}_i)$
%\item \textbf{For event cases} (where $E_{id}^{\text{original}} < T-1$, indicating an actual disease event): $E_{id} = E_{id}^{\text{original}}$ (event times remain unchanged)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Step 4: Apply to prevalence calculation.} When computing prevalence at each age $t$, we only include patients who are still at risk: $$\text{prevalence}_{dt} = \frac{\sum_{i: E_{id} \geq t} Y_{idt}}{\sum_{i: E_{id} \geq t} 1},$$ where the denominator includes only patients who have not yet been censored at timepoint $t$. This ensures prevalence estimates reflect realistic at-risk periods.

\subsubsection*{Likelihood Function}

The likelihood is constructed to respect this censoring structure \cite{kalbfleisch_statistical_2011,cox_regression_1972}. Consider first $\mathcal{L}_{NLL}$, the negative log of the likelihood, that is the negative log of the probability of observed disease histories conditional on the disease probabilities $\pi$'s:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{NLL} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{d=1}^{D} \left[ \underbrace{\sum_{t=1}^{E_{id}-1} \log(1-\pi_{idt})}_{\text{Pre-event survival}} + \underbrace{Y_{idE_{id}} \log(\pi_{idE_{id}})}_{\text{Event occurrence}} + \underbrace{(1-Y_{idE_{id}}) \log(1-\pi_{idE_{id}})}_{\text{Censored observation}} \right]    
\end{equation}
%
The contribution of individual $i$ to this expression has three components:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Pre-event survival} ($t < E_{id}$): For all time points before the event/censoring time, we know that the individual did not have  disease $d$, contributing $\log(1-\pi_{idt})$ to the likelihood at each time.

\item \textbf{Event occurrence} ($t = E_{id}$, $Y_{idE_{id}} = 1$): If  disease $d$ occurred at time $E_{id}$, we observe the event. The corresponding contribution is $\log(\pi_{idE_{id}})$.

\item \textbf{Censored observation} ($t = E_{id}$, $Y_{idE_{id}} = 0$): If the individual was censored without disease at time $E_{id}$, we only know they were disease-free at that time, contributing $\log(1-\pi_{idE_{id}})$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Objective Function for Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) Computation}

The computational derivation of the MAP estimate of the unknown parameters in the model proceeds by optimising the function $\mathcal{L}_{total}$ which includes the negative log-likelihood $\mathcal{L}_{NLL}$ as well as terms arising from the gaussian process prior. 

The negative logs of the Gaussian process terms, as previously specified are:
$$\mathcal{L}_{GP\lambda} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{1}{2} (\lambda_{ik} - \mu_{ik})^{\top} \Omega_{\lambda}^{-1} (\lambda_{ik} - \mu_{ik})$$
$$\mathcal{L}_{GP\phi} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{d=1}^{D} \frac{1}{2} (\phi_{kd} - \mu_d - \psi_{kd})^{\top} \Omega_{\phi}^{-1} (\phi_{kd} - \mu_d - \psi_{kd}).$$
%
Combining these terms, and assuming diffuse near uniform priors on $\kappa$ and $\Gamma$'s, the negative log posterior (the ``loss'' for short) is:
%$$-\mathcal{L}_{total} =
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{NLL} + \mathcal{L}_{GP\lambda} + \mathcal{L}_{GP\phi}
    \label{eqn:loss}
\end{equation}


%This formulation enables \aladyn{} to learn disease progression patterns that respect the temporal structure of the data and provide clinically actionable predictions.
%
%Specifically, the negative log-likelihood leads the model to accurately predict the timing of disease onset. To encourage smoothness and temporal coherence in the latent trajectories, we use GP priors on both the individual-specific latent variables ($\lambda$) and, if applicable, the disease-time effects ($\phi$). The implied regularization terms penalize deviations from the GP prior mean and covariance structure. In models with cluster structure, additional penalties may be included to encourage biologically meaningful clustering of diseases or signatures.

\subsubsection*{Training, Validation and Testing Architecture}

The genetic and performance results in this paper are based on training in the UKB dataset; we also trained the model in the MGBB and AOU datasets to establish consistency as in (\textbf{\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}}; model fit for all three data sets including $\phi$ parameters, disease prevalence $\mu$ and primary $time-fixed$ signature-disease associations $\psi_k$ are evaluable in exported parameters (Extended data)for all three data sets. 
Our analytical approach includes two complementary goals: 1) retrospective analysis for model training and cross-cohort validation; 2) prospective analysis for prediction evaluation, assummarized in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:training_architecture}}.

\textbf{Retrospective Analysis (Figures 2-4):} For computational efficiency and uncertainty quantification, we divided each cohort into non-overlapping subsets: UK Biobank into $B=40$ subsets of approximately 10,000 individuals each (reserving each subset of 10,000 individuals in turn as a held-out test set), All of Us into 30 subsets, and Mass General Brigham into 4 subsets (reflecting the smaller dataset sizes). For each subset $b$ within each cohort, we jointly estimated the disease-signature associations ($\hat{\phi}^{(b)}$) and individual loadings ($\hat{\lambda}^{(b)}$) using all available observed data up to age 81 or censoring time, whichever came first. This retrospective approach utilized the complete disease trajectory for each individual, enabling us to characterize the full spectrum of disease signatures and their temporal dynamics. For initialization, each subset uses the same pre-computed initial clusters and $\psi$ parameters, facilitating consistent signature interpretations across all subsets within each cohort.

For UK Biobank, the final disease-signature parameters used for explanatory analyses were computed as the average across the 40 training subsets (excluding the held-out test set):
$$\phi = \frac{1}{40} \sum_{b=1}^{40} \phi^{(b)}$$
This subset-averaging approach provides robust parameter estimates while maintaining computational tractability. Additionally, it facilitates assessment of estimation robustness. The AOU and MGB cohorts serve as external validation datasets, demonstrating the replicability of disease signatures across different populations and healthcare systems. No prediction tasks were performed on these two cohorts. 

This subset-averaged $\phi$ was used to generate the disease signature visualizations in Figure 2, including the temporal patterns and cross-cohort consistency analyses. Individual trajectory analyses (Figure 3) utilized the subset-specific $\lambda^{(b)}$ estimates, and subsequent clustering of patients by their time-averaged signature loadings was performed within each disease category. The genetic analyses (Figure 4) were performed exclusively in UK Biobank, employing the area-under-the-curve of individual signature trajectories as quantitative phenotypes for genome-wide association studies.
 
\textbf{Prospective Analysis (Figure 5):} For prediction evaluation, we implemented a strictly prospective framework using only UK Biobank data with leave-one-out cross-validation to ensure robust, generalizable performance estimates. We used a subset of 400,000 individuals (the first 400,000 eIDs, which are random, in 40 batches of 10,000 each) from the full UK Biobank cohort of 427,239 individuals for computational efficiency in the cross-validation framework. For each of 40 batches, we trained models on the remaining 39 batches to learn population-level parameters: disease-signature associations ($\phi$), signature offsets ($\psi$), genetic effects ($\gamma$), and the global calibration parameter ($\kappa$). These parameters were then fixed, and predictions for the held-out batch of 10,000 individuals were generated by learning only individual-specific trajectories ($\hat{\lambda}$) using only data available up to specific prediction time points. 

This approach ensures no information leakage from the held-out batch.
%and mirrors the intended application scenario, where population parameters are learned from a training cohort and then fixed for prediction on new patients.
%Specifically, for each prediction time point, we censored individual disease histories at that time point and re-estimated only the individual loadings while keeping $\phi$ fixed. 
It also reflects the intended real-world clinical scenarios where population-level disease patterns are known from prior research, but individual risk trajectories must be estimated from available clinical history up to the prediction time. All prediction performance metrics reported in this paper are based on this leave-one-out cross-validation approach.

\subsubsection*{Model Initialization}

To ensure computational feasibility and parameter stability we initialize training as follows. We perform the spectral clustering of diagnoses described below and use it to derive starting values for $\psi$. We do this once on the entire data set to establish stable disease clusters and signature-disease associations. These initial $\psi$ values are then reused in all subsequent subset analyses for $b = 1, \ldots, 40$. 

Spectral clustering is performed using Scikit on disease co-occurrence patterns. We compute a disease co-occurrence matrix $C$ where $C_{dd'}$ represents the frequency with which diseases $d$ and $d'$ co-occur in the same patient. We apply spectral clustering to this matrix to identify $K$ disease clusters. 

We then initialize the $\psi_{kd}$ parameters based on cluster membership: for diseases in cluster $k$, we set $\psi_{kd} = 1.0 + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is a small random noise.  For diseases not in cluster $k$, we set $\psi_{kd} = -2.0 + \epsilon$. The choice of initial $\psi$ was initialized at values of 1 and $-2$, which on the log scale correspond to a 20-fold difference in odds (i.e., $10^{-9}$ vs $10^{-11}$), thereby spanning a broad range of plausible values for disease risk. For the time-varying parameters $\lambda_{ikt}$ and $\phi_{kdt}$, we initialize by drawing a single sample from the corresponding Gaussian process prior with reduced variance to preserve the structured mean initialization. Specifically, we initialize $\lambda_{ikt}$ via a random draw from the Gaussian process prior with mean $r_k + \Gamma_k^{\top}\mathbf{g}_i$ and covariance kernel scaled by amplitude $\alpha = 0.1$, where $\Gamma_k$ is initialized using regression on disease occurrences. We initialize $\phi_{kdt}$ via a random draw from the Gaussian process prior with mean $\mu_d + \psi_{kd}$ and the same reduced amplitude, where $\mu_d$ is derived from the logit of disease prevalence. The reduced amplitude ensures that random deviations do not bias the parameters arbitrarily away from the informative mean structure while maintaining temporal smoothness. We generate the GP samples via Cholesky decomposition of the scaled kernel matrices. This approach provides a structured and plausible initialization that reflects our prior smoothness assumptions. 
%gp here
The number of latent signatures $K$ was chosen to provide a parsimonious balance between model complexity and interpretability, based on prior experience and exploratory analysis. 

\subsubsection*{Optimization Details}

We trained the model using gradient descent to minimize the loss (\ref{eqn:loss}. The solution can be interpreted as approximating a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the parameters, assuming dispersed priors on $\lambda$'s, $\Gamma$'s, $\mu$'s $\psi$'s and $\phi$'s. We minimize the loss (\ref{eqn:loss}) over a fixed maximum number of epochs (i.e. complete passes through the entire training dataset). At each epoch, we compute gradients via backpropagation and update parameters using the Adam optimizer in PyTorch, a deep learning framework that allows efficient computation of gradients through automatic differentiation. The model was trained using a learning rate of 0.01. The model is optimized at a time scale of one year and thus trained to provide the most accurate 1-year risk predictions. Longer-term risk (e.g., 10-year) can also be derived by simple manipulations of the estimated $\pi$'s.

For computational efficiency, we used the Cholesky decomposition to compute the Gaussian process contributions and to sample from the Gaussian process prior during initialization. We also used a jitter term of $1^{-6}$ to ensure numerical stability when computing the inverse of the kernel matrices.
In practice, for our subsets of 10000 individuals, the model converged after 200 epochs. For inference on new patients, the vectorized implementation enables rapid risk prediction: generating predictions for a single individual requires approximately 0.05 second (or 8 minutes for 10000 individuals), making the model suitable for real-time clinical decision support.

\subsubsection*{Computation of Probabilities of Future Events}

To ensure that our model provides prospective predictions without data leakage, we implement a strict censoring strategy that distinguishes between cohort recruitment and prediction time. This approach allows us to simulate real-world clinical scenarios where predictions are made based only on information available at a specific point in time (\textbf{\ref{fig:recruitment_timeline}}).

\textit{Cohort enrollment time} refers to the time point when an individual entries \aladyn{}, which for our purposes is age 30. For example, in our UKB analysis, all individuals were followed in the EHR from 1980 forward\cite{urbut_msgene_2023,yeung_niekverwukbpheno_2022} and thus assigned an enrollment time in our study at young adulthood, age 30, or whichever comes later. 

\textit{Cohort recruitment time} refers to the time when individuals joined the Biobank. The UKB recruited individuals aged between 40 and 69 years in the time frame from 2006 to 2010 (\cite{sudlow_uk_2015}).

\textit{Prediction time} refers to the time when we imagine making a clinical prediction, with knowledge of the health history up until that time. 

\textit{Prediction time for benchmarking with existing clinical risk scores} In practice, when comparing to existing clinical scores, this coincides with recruitment time as above. 

In the UKB, an individual is observed in the EHR from adulthood and contributed data to our analysis from age 30 until the end of follow-up. However, for prediction analyses, we only make predictions attime points after the cohort recruitment time.

\subsubsection*{Simulation Study}

To validate the ability of the \aladyn{} model to recover latent disease clusters and temporal dynamics, we conducted a simulation study using \aladyn{} itself as the generative model. This approach allows us to test whether the model can accurately recover known ground truth parameters from synthetic data that follows the exact same probabilistic structure as our proposed model (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:simulation}}).

We generated synthetic data with $N=10,000$ individuals, $D=20$ diseases, $T=50$ time points (ages 30-79), $K=5$ latent disease signatures, and $P=5$ genetic covariates. The data generation process follows \aladyn's exact mathematical formulation. We first created $K=5$ distinct disease clusters with 4 diseases per cluster, assigning strong positive associations within clusters ($\psi_{kd} = 1.0$) and strong negative associations outside clusters ($\psi_{kd} = -2.0$). Disease baseline trajectories ($\mu_d$) were generated on the logit scale with diverse prevalence patterns ranging from rare (logit prevalence $\approx -14$) to common (logit prevalence $\approx -8$), incorporating realistic age-dependent onset patterns with varying peak ages and slopes.

For individual trajectories, we generated genetic covariates $\mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times P}$ and genetic effect matrices $\Gamma_k \in \mathbb{R}^{P \times K}$, then sampled individual signature loadings $\lambda_{ikt}$ from Gaussian processes with means $\mathbf{g}_i^{\top}\Gamma_k$ and temporal covariance with length scale $T/4 = 12.5$ years. Disease-signature associations $\phi_{kdt}$ were sampled from Gaussian processes with means $\mu_d + \psi_{kd}$ and temporal covariance with length scale $T/3 \approx 16.7$ years. Event probabilities were computed using the exact \aladyn{}formula: $\pi_{idt} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{softmax}(\lambda_{ikt}) \cdot \text{sigmoid}(\phi_{kdt})$, and disease events were sampled from these time-varying probabilities.

When we applied \aladyn{} to these synthetic data, the model successfully recovered the composition of the signatures (Adjusted Rand Index = 0.843, Normalized Mutual Information = 0.943), and accurately reconstructed the temporal trajectories and genetic effects.

\subsubsection*{\underline{Cohorts}}

Data are drawn from three distinct biobanks: Massachusetts General Brigham (MGB), UK Biobank (UKB), and All of Us (AoU). Each cohort is described in \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:baseline_characteristics}} and below (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:cohort_design}}).

\subsubsection*{Massachusetts General Brigham Biobank (MGBB)}

MGBB is an integrated research initiative based in Boston, Massachusetts \cite{koyama_decoding_2023}. It collects biological samples and health data from consenting individuals at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and local healthcare sites within the MGB network. Since July 1, 2010, the MGBB has enrolled more than 140,000 participants and extracted DNA from approximately 90,000 participants' samples, and 53,306 participants were genotyped by Illumina Global Screening Array (Illumina, CA). All participants provided their informed written / electronic consent. EHR data are available on all participants from approximately 1990 (see S7). We used a subset of 48,069 for whom EHR and genetic data were available. \textbf{Cohort inclusion criteria:} All individuals with available EHR and genetic data were included; no restrictions were placed on the number of visits or age at enrollment, as the model accommodates variable follow-up times through its censoring framework.

\subsubsection*{UK Biobank (UKB)}

The UKB is a large-scale, population-based cohort that recruited over 500,000 participants aged 40–69 years between 2006 and 2010 from across the United Kingdom \cite{sudlow_uk_2015,bycroft_uk_2018}. The cohort includes extensive phenotypic data, biological samples, and longitudinal follow-up of health outcomes. Genotyping was performed using the UK BiLEVE array or the UKB Axiom array, with subsequent imputation to the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) and UK10K reference panels. Participants were genotyped to investigate genetic contributions to various health and disease traits, with particular attention to the relationship between genetic variants and cardiometabolic diseases. Electronic health records are available on all participants from approximately 1980, and some as early as 1980 \cite{urbut_ms_2023} and thus allow access to clinical diagnostic data prior to the recruitment date). We used the subset of 427,239 for whom genomic and EHR data were available. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were obtained from an external set of controls \cite{thompson_uk_2022}.

\subsubsection*{All of US (AOU)}

The AOU research program \cite{the_all_of_us_research_program_investigators_all_2019} is a large-scale cohort study designed to increase the representation of historically understudied populations in biomedical research. Since 2018, AOU enrolled adults $(age \geq 18)$ at more than 730 US sites. Of the 800,000+ consented participants, more than 560,000 have completed core enrollment requirements, including health questionnaires and biospecimen collection. Data from these participants are continuously linked to electronic health records (EHR), which capture ICD-9 / ICD-10, SNOMED, and CPT codes. Genetic data includes array-based genotyping from 315,000 participants and whole genome sequencing (WGS) from 245,394 participants who were then available to contribute polygenic risk scores for downstream analyzes. 

\subsubsection*{Preprocessing and Disease Encoding}

Following the approach of Jiang et al. \cite{jiang_age-dependent_2023}, we initially analyzed 348 PheCode diseases from UK Biobank that were selected based on prevalence thresholds ($\geq$1,000 occurrences) to ensure sufficient statistical power for comorbidity analysis. This threshold was chosen to balance disease coverage with statistical power: diseases with fewer than 1,000 occurrences would have insufficient power for reliable signature assignment. We focused on ICD-10 chapters A--N (disease chapters), excluding injury (S, T), poisoning, external causes of morbidity and mortality (V--Y), factors influencing health status (Z), and codes for special purposes (U). Disease records were mapped from ICD-10/ICD-10CM codes to PheCodes using a standardized three-step procedure: (1) direct ICD-10 to PheCode mapping using established PheCode definitions \cite{bastarache_using_2021}, (2) aggregation of related ICD codes to single PheCode categories, and (3) validation of mapping consistency across cohorts. To validate our findings across independent populations, we then applied the same disease selection strategy to All of Us (AOU) and Mass General Brigham (MGB) cohorts using their respective ICD coding systems. In AOU, we extracted ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes directly from the OMOP Common Data Model condition occurrence tables \cite{the_all_of_us_research_program_investigators_all_2019}, successfully reproducing all 348 diseases from the UK Biobank selection. In MGB, we similarly used ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, reproducing 346 of the 348 diseases for validation analyses. This multi-cohort approach enabled us to assess the generalizability of disease signatures across different healthcare systems and populations while maintaining consistency in the underlying disease definitions used for \aladyn{} model development and validation.  

\subsubsection*{\underline{Analysis}}

\textbf{Stability Across Subsets and Cohorts} 

We empirically verified that $\phi$ estimates were highly stable across subsets. To assess robustness to natural variation in sample composition, we computed standard errors of $\phi$ parameters across all 40 training batches. Each batch represents 10,000 individuals with slight variation in composition across batches. For each $\phi$ parameter (signature-disease-time combination), we calculated the standard error of the mean as the standard deviation across batches divided by $\sqrt{40}$. We observed small standard errors (mean SE = 0.0010, median SE = 0.0002, 95\% of SE values $\leq$ 0.004), demonstrating the robustness of our disease-signature associations to batch-to-batch variation in sample composition (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:phi_batch}}). 

To further assess the replicability of our disease signatures across different populations (shown in Figure 2C of the main paper), we performed cluster correspondence as follows (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:signature-dynamics}D}). We examined the correspondence between disease clusters identified in each biobank by creating normalized confusion matrices. For each pair of biobanks (UKB vs MGB and UKB vs AoU), we identified the set of diseases common to both biobanks, mapped each disease to its assigned cluster in each biobank based on posterior fitting (disease-to-signature assignments determined by the signature with maximum posterior association strength, $\text{argmax}_k(\psi_{kd})$), created a cross-tabulation matrix showing the proportion of diseases in each UKB cluster that were assigned to each MGB/AoU cluster, and normalized the counts by row to show the distribution of cluster assignments. 

We computed a composition preservation probability index to quantify cross-cohort correspondence. For each UKB cluster $k$, we identified its best-matching cluster in the comparison cohort (the cluster receiving the highest proportion of diseases from that UKB cluster). The composition preservation probability for cluster $k$ is defined as:
$$J_k = \frac{|D_{k,\text{UKB}} \cap D_{k^*,\text{other}}|}{|D_{k,\text{UKB}}|}$$
where $D_{k,\text{UKB}}$ is the set of diseases in UKB cluster $k$ (determined by posterior $\psi$ values, $\text{argmax}_k(\psi_{kd})$), $D_{k^*,\text{other}}$ is the set of diseases in the best-matching cluster $k^*$ in the comparison cohort (also determined by posterior $\psi$ values), and $|\cdot|$ denotes set cardinality. This metric represents the proportion of diseases in a UKB signature that also belong to its best-matching signature in the comparison cohort (i.e., the intersection size divided by the UKB signature size, rather than the traditional Jaccard intersection-over-union). The overall cross-cohort similarity is the median of these cluster-specific similarities: $J = \text{median}(J_1, J_2, \ldots, J_K)$ across all UKB clusters. This metric ranges from 0 (no correspondence) to 1 (perfect correspondence), where higher values indicate stronger replicability of disease clustering patterns across populations.

This analysis revealed strong correspondence between clusters across biobanks (median composition preservation probability = 0.80), particularly for cardiovascular and malignancy signatures, suggesting robust biological patterns that transcend population differences.

For temporal pattern analysis, we performed a detailed comparison of the temporal patterns ($\phi$ trajectories) for diseases shared across all three biobanks, focusing on two key signatures: the cardiovascular signature (MGB: Sig 5, AoU: Sig 16, UKB: Sig 5) and the malignancy signature (MGB: Sig 11, AoU: Sig 11, UKB: Sig 6). For each signature, we identified diseases assigned to that signature in all three biobanks, plotted the temporal patterns ($\phi$ values) for each shared disease, overlaid the average pattern across all three biobanks (gray dashed line, \textbf{\ref{fig:signature-dynamics}}), and used consistent colors for each disease across biobanks to facilitate comparison. This analysis demonstrated consistency in the temporal patterns of disease risk across different populations, with shared diseases showing similar risk trajectories despite being modeled separately in each biobank.

\subsubsection*{Individual Patient Trajectory Visualization}

To illustrate the complex interplay of disease signatures in individual patients (shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:signature-dynamics} A} of the main paper), we analyzed detailed trajectories for patients with multiple conditions.  

For each selected patient, we created a three-panel visualization showing temporal signature loadings, a disease timeline with diagnosis timing, and disease specific probabilities, and then contrasted with the time-averaged signature contributions.

\subsubsection*{Disease-Specific Trajectory and Heterogeneity Analysis}

To systematically quantify differences in signature composition among patients with the same clinical diagnosis and understand disease progression heterogeneity and associated genetic architectures (Figures 3F, 4B-D), we performed trajectory clustering analysis using the \aladyn{} model. For each disease of interest (e.g., breast cancer, major depressive disorder, myocardial infarction), we implemented the following analysis pipeline:

\textbf{Patient Selection and Temporal Averaging.} For each disease, we identified all patients who developed the condition and computed their time-averaged normalized signature loadings:
$$\bar{\theta}_{ik} = \frac{1}{T_i} \sum_{t=1}^{T_i} \theta_{ikt}$$
where $\theta_{ikt}$ is the signature loading for individual $i$, signature $k$, and time $t$.

\textbf{Patient Clustering.} We applied k-means clustering (k=3) to the time-averaged signature loading matrix $\bar{\theta}_{ik}$ to identify illustrative distinct patient subgroups within each disease category.

\textbf{Trajectory Visualization.} We computed cluster-specific mean trajectories across individuals within the cluster $\mu_{ckt} = \frac{1}{|C_c|} \sum_{i \in C_c} \theta_{ikt}$ and visualized deviations from population reference as filled line plots for each time point: $\Delta_{ckt} = \mu_{ckt} - \text{ref}_{kt}$, where $\text{ref}_{kt}$ represents the population-average signature loading.

\textbf{Genetic Architecture Analysis.} For each cluster, we computed mean polygenic risk scores (PRS) across individuals in the cluster, and created heatmaps showing cluster-specific values of these scores. To quantify variability of PRS scores among individuals with the same disease, we calculated Cohen's $d$ effect sizes for each PRS comparing in-cluster versus out-of-cluster distributions:
$$d = \frac{\bar{X}_{\text{in}} - \bar{X}_{\text{out}}}{s_{\text{pooled}}}$$
where $\bar{X}_{\text{in}}$ and $\bar{X}_{\text{out}}$ are the mean PRS values for patients within and outside each cluster, respectively, and $s_{\text{pooled}}$ is the pooled standard deviation. Cohen's $d$ values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively, providing a standardized measure of genetic differentiation between patient subgroups.

For cluster $c$ and signature $k$, \Ccsig is the standardized difference in mean time-averaged signature loadings between individuals in cluster $c$ and those in all other clusters. This measures how distinct each cluster is with regard to each disease signature. Similarly, for cluster $c$ and PRS $p$, \Ccprs is the standardized difference in mean PRS values between individuals in cluster $c$ and those in all other clusters.

Confidence intervals and p-values for Cohen's $d$ were estimated, and significance was assessed to determine whether the observed cluster differences were likely to be due to chance.

\subsubsection*{Deviation pathway Heterogeneity Analysis for Myocardial Infarction}
As a supplementary analysis, to identify illustrative biological pathways to myocardial infarction using deviation-from-reference clustering, we performed the following supplementary analysis. For each individual with a myocardial infarction diagnosis, we extracted signature loadings ($\theta_{ik}(t)$) over the 10-year window preceding the MI event. We computed signature deviations by subtracting the population reference trajectory for each signature: $\delta_{ikt} = \theta_{ikt} - \bar{\theta}_{kt}$, where $\bar{\theta}_{kt}$ is the population mean signature loading at age $t$. This deviation-based approach removes age-related confounding and focuses on disease-specific patterns relative to expected population trajectories. For each patient, we computed a 105-dimensional feature vector (21 signatures × 5 timepoints) representing mean signature deviations across the 10-year pre-MI window. Patients were clustered into pathways using K-means clustering (K=4) on these deviation vectors. Pathway assignment was validated through: (1) cross-cohort replication in Mass General Brigham using identical clustering procedures, (2) comparison of precursor disease prevalence patterns across pathways, and (3) signature trajectory visualization to confirm biological interpretability. Cross-cohort validation was performed by applying the UK Biobank cluster centroids to the MGB cohort and comparing pathway sizes and disease enrichment patterns.

\subsubsection*{Genetic Analysis of Signature Trajectories}

For each individual $i$, we compute the temporal signature loadings $\theta_{ik}(t)$ for each signature $k$ and timepoint $t$ using the softmax transformation:

$$\theta_{ikt} = \frac{\exp(\lambda_{ikt})}{\sum_{k'} \exp(\lambda_{ik't})}$$

where $\lambda_{ik}(t)$ is the latent score for individual $i$, signature $k$, and time $t$. The softmax is computed across the signature dimension for each individual and timepoint. To summarize each individual's overall exposure to a given signature, we integrate the signature trajectory over time:
%
$$\mathrm{AEX}_{ik} = \int \theta_{ikt} \, dt \approx \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \frac{\theta_{ikt} + \theta_{ik(t+1)}}{2}$$
%
where $T$ is the total number of timepoints. The resulting average signature exposure over time (AEX) for each signature is used as a quantitative phenotype for downstream genetic association analysis (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:aex_calculation}}).

We perform GWAS using the AEX values as quantitative phenotypes. For each signature $k$, we test for association between the AEX phenotype and genome-wide SNP genotypes. Association testing is performed using the Regenie \cite{mbatchou_computationally_2021} software (described below), which implements a two-step ridge regression approach for computational efficiency and control of population structure. 

\textbf{Genetic ancestry handling:} All GWAS analyses included individuals of all genetic ancestries (not restricted to European ancestry), with population structure controlled through inclusion of the first 20 principal components (PCs) of genetic ancestry as covariates. This approach allows us to leverage the full diversity of the UK Biobank while properly accounting for population stratification. The following covariates are included in all association models: sex, age at recruitment, and the first 20 principal components (PCs) of genetic ancestry \cite{sudlow_uk_2015}.

\subsubsection*{GWAS details}

We performed genome-wide association studies using Regenie \cite{mbatchou_computationally_2021}, a two-step ridge regression approach designed for computational efficiency and robust control of population structure in large biobank-scale datasets. 

\textbf{Step 1: Whole-genome ridge regression.} We fit a whole-genome ridge regression model using all genetic variants to account for polygenic effects, relatedness, and population structure. The model was fit using leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) cross-validation, where predictions for each chromosome exclude variants from that chromosome to prevent overfitting. This step produces polygenic predictions that capture the aggregate genetic background.

\textbf{Step 2: Single-variant association testing.} We performed single-variant association tests on the residuals from Step 1, testing each of 6,418,439 imputed variants (MAF $\geq$ 0.01, INFO $\geq$ 0.7) individually. By testing variants on pre-adjusted residuals rather than raw phenotypes, this approach provides well-calibrated association statistics that are robust to case-control imbalance, relatedness, and population stratification. All models included covariates for sex, age at recruitment, and the first 20 principal components of genetic ancestry. Genome-wide significance was set at $P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$. We identify nearby genes using both nearest gene and gene body analyses (Ensembl and GnomaAD).

In addition to our main analysis featured in \ref{fig:genetics}, for each signature, we identify genome-wide significant SNPs (e.g., $P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$) and further analyze their relationships with individual disease phenotypes and nearby genes. The analysis proceeds as follows. First, we extract the lead SNPs from the GWAS summary statistics for each signature. For our supplementary analyses (\ref{fig:snp_phenotype}), for each top SNP, we test its association with a panel of binary constituent disease phenotypes which comprise our signature inputs using logistic regression, controlling for sex and the first 20 PCs. Third, we visualize the matrix of SNP--phenotype association strength ($-\log_{10}(P)$) using heatmaps, marking associations significant at $P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$. This enables identification of signature-specific loci---SNPs associated with the signature but not with any individual constituent disease. Fourth, we use UpSet plots to visualize the overlap of significant variants across signatures and individual diseases. %Fifth, for variants shared between signatures and diseases, we assess the consistency of effect directions across traits.

\subsubsection*{LDSC Heritability Analysis}
Heritability estimates ($h^2$) represent the proportion of phenotypic variance in signature trajectories that can be attributed to additive genetic variation. Because our signature phenotypes are continuous (integrated area under the signature loading curve), all heritability estimates are on the observed scale, that is, there is no liability-scale transformation for continuous traits.

Heritability estimates for signature trajectories were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) \cite{bulik-sullivan_ld_2015} on the GWAS summary statistics generated from Regenie. For each signature, we applied LDSC with standard parameters using the European ancestry LD reference panel (baseline LD v2.2), following standard practice for heritability estimation from GWAS summary statistics. The LDSC intercept was used to assess potential residual confounding and genomic inflation. For comparison with component diseases, we also performed GWAS for individual cardiovascular traits (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, hypercholesterolemia, coronary atherosclerosis, acute ischemic heart disease, chronic ischemic heart disease, unstable angina) using the same Regenie workflow and covariates (sex, age at recruitment, first 20 genetic PCs), then computed LDSC heritability estimates for each trait. For valid comparison, we report observed-scale heritability for binary traits; liability-scale estimates are provided separately for reference against literature values that typically report on that scale(Table~\ref{tab:component_cvd_heritabilities_liability}). 

\subsubsection*{Rare Variant Association Studies (RVAS)}
Gene-based rare variant association studies were performed using Regenie \cite{mbatchou_computationally_2021} gene-based association tests. For each signature, we tested associations between signature AEX values and aggregated rare variant burden within genes across six variant filtering masks (Mask1-Mask6), representing progressively inclusive functional impact categories (Mask1: most restrictive, Mask6: most inclusive). Each mask was further stratified by minor allele frequency (MAF) thresholds (singleton, $1 \times 10^{-5}$, $0.0001$, $0.001$, $0.01$, $0.1$). Variants were annotated using Ensembl VEP (Variant Effect Predictor) and aggregated at the gene level as well as Encode using nearest gene. The gene-based test statistic aggregates variant-level association signals within each gene, accounting for linkage disequilibrium and variant effect sizes. Genome-wide significance was set at $p < 2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ after Bonferroni correction for the number of genes tested ($18,464$ genes). Significant genes were identified across all masks to ensure robustness to variant filtering criteria, with genes discovered in multiple masks considered high-confidence associations.

\subsubsection*{Three-Way Validation of Rare Variant Associations}
To validate rare variant associations through an independent pathway, we examined the three-way consistency between (1) signature-gene associations from RVAS, (2) gene-disease correlations from rare variant burden analysis, and (3) disease-signature loadings from the $\phi$ parameters. For each signature-gene pair identified through RVAS, we computed rare variant burden scores for each individual by summing variant counts (burden = $\sum(2 - X)$, where $X$ is the genotype matrix with PLINK encoding. We then calculated Pearson correlations between rare variant burden and binary disease outcomes across all diseases. Finally, we tested whether diseases with high rare variant burden correlations also showed high signature-disease loadings ($\phi$ values) by computing the correlation between the vector of gene-disease correlations and the vector of disease-signature loadings. This three-way validation provides biological plausibility by demonstrating that: (1) rare variant carriers show disease enrichment consistent with signature associations, and (2) signature-disease loadings reflect the same underlying biology captured by rare variant-disease associations.

\subsubsection*{Clinical Validation: Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Clonal Hematopoiesis}
To validate the biological meaningfulness of disease signatures, we performed targeted analyses of two well-characterized genetic conditions with known disease associations. \textbf{Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH):} We identified FH carriers using genetic variants in LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 following established criteria \cite{khera_diagnosis_2016}. For FH carriers and matched controls, we computed signature loadings and tested for enrichment of Signature 5 (cardiovascular signature) in the 5-year window preceding first ASCVD event (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, or stroke). For each patient with an ASCVD event, we computed the pre-event change in Signature 5 loading ($\Delta$Sig5) over the 5-year window preceding the event, defined as the difference between signature loading at 1 year before the event and at 5 years before the event. We then classified patients as showing a "pre-event rise" if $\Delta$Sig5 $\geq$ 0. Enrichment was quantified by comparing the proportion of FH carriers versus non-carriers who showed a pre-event rise using Fisher's exact test on a 2×2 contingency table (rise/no-rise × carrier/non-carrier), with one-sided alternative testing for higher enrichment in carriers. Results were reported as odds ratios with p-values from Fisher's exact test.

\subsubsection*{Model Evaluation and Comparison}
 
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:performance}} presents a comprehensive evaluation of our multi-disease risk prediction model in the UKB, and comparisons with important single-disease models. Each is evaluated in a strictly prospective, leakage-free framework. In the testing data, all individual level parameters were estimated using only information available up to the time of  prediction. Individuals with prevalent disease at prediction were excluded from the risk set for that disease. In UKB all individuals are followed for at least 10 years from recruitment. We considered the following prediction tasks and metrics.%In our analysis we consider only these initial 10 years to avoid comparing metrics obtained across differing risk sets to be comparable to existing scores, but this can easily be extended over the full set of available prediction times. 

\textbf{Median AUC Aladynoulli Dynamic:} This metric evaluates the model's ability to make dynamic predictions at multiple time points during follow-up: it is derived by refitting the Aladynoulli model using fixed $\hat{\phi}$, $\hat{\gamma}$ and $\kappa$ parameters, previously estimated from the full-history training data, and now applied to a series of one-year prediction tasks. Critically, while the fixed parameters above were estimated from the full training data, the $\hat \lambda$'s for each prediction task are now estimated using data only up to the point of prediction. For each of the first 10 years after recruitment, the model is retrained using only data available up to that point for the held out test set (in orange in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:training_architecture}}). The median area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) across these ten dynamic one-year fits is reported. This captures how predictive accuracy evolves as patients accumulate new diagnoses and leverages the flexibility of our method to perform dynamic, prospective risk estimation at any time point. Individuals with prevalent disease at prediction time were excluded from the risk set.

\textbf{Aladynoulli Recruitment (1-year):} This metric uses the Aladynoulli model's predicted 1-year risk at the time of recruitment, evaluated against observed 1-year outcomes. The risk estimate is $\tilde{\pi}_{idt}$, the predicted 1-year risk for individual $i$  recruited at time $t$ for disease $d$. In practice, any age of prediction could be chosen, but we use the age of recruitment to the UK Biobank because it is the only time at which we have the availability of additional clinical variables required for comparability with existing clinical benchmarks. 

%gp here 
\textbf{Aladynoulli Recruitment (10-year):} This metric uses the Aladynoulli model's predicted 1-year risk at the time of recruitment, evaluated against observed 10-year outcomes. The risk estimate is $\tilde{\pi}_{idt}$, as in the 1-year predictions.

\textbf{Cox:} For benchmarking purposes we employ a `baseline Cox model useing only family history and sex as covariates, with age as the time scale delineating start and stop of the interval, representing a minimal clinical model that does not require any model curation or disease-specific features. This highlights the fact that our approach does not rely on disease-specific risk factors or manual feature engineering.

When benchmarking AUC performance, we compared the \aladyn{} model not only to the benchmarking Cox proportional hazards model above, but also to established clinical risk scores: PREVENT \cite{khan_development_2024}, Pooled Cohort Equation \cite{lloyd_estimating_2017} for ASCVD, and Gail \cite{gail_projecting_1989} for breast cancer, models for diseases where these scores are available after specific and often expensive curation. Of note, these clinical risk scores require laboratory values and biomarkers that are either collected during targeted clinical visits (introducing selection bias) or, when extracted from routine EHR data, may be subject to measurement bias since sicker patients typically receive more frequent testing. In contrast, our approach leverages routinely collected diagnostic codes (ICD codes) that are systematically recorded for all patients regardless of disease severity, providing a more unbiased data source for risk prediction.

This approach ensured that all model comparisons were fair, prospective, and reflective of the information available at the time of risk assessment. 

% Additional evaluation (\textbf{Table \ref{tab:rolling_interpolation}})

\textbf{Dynamic 10-year Rolling:} This approach demonstrates the model's interpolation capabilities by evaluating how probability estimates evolve as new information becomes available. For each year of the 10-year horizon, we update the model's predictions using information available up to that time point, then aggregate the cumulative 10-year risk as $1-\prod_{t=1}^{10} (1 - \hat{\pi}_{idt})$, where $\hat{\pi}_{idt}$ is the predicted risk for individual $i$ and disease $d$ at year $t$ after recruitment. While this rolling evaluation does not use knowledge of the future outcome of interest, it is not leakage-free. This is because it does incorporate future information about events that are potentially correlated with, or even resulting from, the event of interest, because the model's probability estimates at year $t$ are influenced by information available up to year $t$. Thus it is best understood as interpolation rather than extrapolation. While this metric cannot be used for prospective evaluation, it demonstrates the model's technical capabilities for dynamic risk assessment and shows how probability estimates evolve over time.

\paragraph*{Additional Methodological Challenges}

We conducted a series of analyses to assess the robustness of \aladyn{} to selection bias, population stratification, temporal leakage, and reverse causation, complementing the primary analyses described in the main text. We provide technical details next.

\textbf{Three key methodological features:} (1) \textbf{Inverse probability weighting (IPW)} to correct for UK Biobank participation bias while preserving biological signal; (2) \textbf{Comprehensive washout analyses} (1-6 months and 1-2 years) to assess temporal leakage and reverse causation; and (3) \textbf{Patient-specific censoring} using realistic follow-up times to properly handle competing risks. These strengthen the validity and generalizability of our findings.

\paragraph*{Selection Bias and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW).}
To evaluate robustness to participation bias in UK Biobank, we implemented inverse probability weighting (IPW) following Schoeler et al. (\cite{schoeler_impact_2025}). We fit a lasso-regularized logistic regression model for biobank participation using demographic and socioeconomic variables (region, birth year, sex, household characteristics, employment status, housing tenure, ethnicity, self-reported health, and education) and computed each individual's predicted participation probability $\hat{p}_i$. 

Inverse probability weights were defined as
\[
w_i^* = \frac{0.0434}{\hat{p}_i},
\]
where 4.34\% is the estimated participation rate in the source population, with $w_i^*$ trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles to avoid undue influence of extreme weights. These raw weights are then normalized to sum to $N$:
\[
w_i = w_i^* \cdot \frac{N}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_j^*},
\]
ensuring that the weighted sample size equals the observed sample size for proper loss scaling.

The weighted loss function modifies the data likelihood component of Equation~\ref{eq:total_loss} to incorporate individual weights. The weighted negative log-likelihood is:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLL}}^{\text{weighted}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \left[ 
    \sum_{d=1}^{D} \sum_{t=1}^{E_{id}-1} \log \bigl(1-\pi_{idt}\bigr)
    + Y_{idE_{id}} \, \log \bigl(\pi_{idE_{id}}\bigr)
    + \bigl(1 - Y_{idE_{id}}\bigr) \, \log \bigl(1-\pi_{idE_{id}}\bigr)
\right],
\label{eq:ipw_loss}
\end{equation}
%
Where $w_i$ is the normalized IPW weight for individual $i$. The Gaussian process prior terms ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{GP}\lambda}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{GP}\phi}$) remain unweighted, as they represent priors on model parameters rather than data contributions.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}^{\text{weighted}} 
    = \mathcal{L}_{\text{NLL}}^{\text{weighted}}
    + \mathcal{L}_{\text{GP}\lambda}
    + \mathcal{L}_{\text{GP}\phi}.
    \label{eq:ipw_loss_global}
\end{equation}

This formulation ensures that individuals with lower predicted participation probabilities (underrepresented groups) contribute proportionally more to parameter estimation, effectively rebalancing the training data toward the source population distribution. 

\paragraph*{Population Stratification and Genetic Ancestry.}
To assess the impact of population structure on signatures, we performed both PC-adjusted and ancestry-stratified analyses.\footnote{See R3\_Population\_Stratification\_Ancestry.ipynb.}
First, we compared models fit with versus without genetic principal components in the Gaussian process mean for $\lambda$ (Equation~3), holding all other settings fixed.
Disease–signature associations ($\phi$) were nearly identical between models (correlation $= 1.000$, mean absolute difference $< 0.002$), demonstrating that disease–signature relationships are robust to PC adjustment.
In contrast, individual signature loadings ($\theta$) showed ancestry-specific shifts, with cardiovascular Signature 5 exhibiting the largest deviation for South Asian (SAS) individuals, consistent with known elevated cardiovascular risk in this group.
Second, we performed PCA on time-averaged signature loadings and examined clustering by ancestry (EUR, AFR, EAS, SAS), finding substantial overlap between groups with modest deviations along principal components for AFR, EAS, and SAS.
Finally, we compared \aladyn{} predictions to Cox baseline models including age, sex, and genetic PCs, confirming that \aladyn{} retains a performance advantage across ancestry groups, indicating that its gains are not explained by ancestry covariates alone (Extended Data Figure S31).

\paragraph*{Reverse Causation Assessment: Short-Term Washout.}
To test whether predictions are driven by diagnostic cascades immediately preceding events, we excluded events occurring within 1, 3, and 6 months of enrollment.\footnote{See R3\_AvoidingReverseCausation.ipynb.}
Performance remained robust with minimal AUC degradation (mean drop $= 0.0112$ for 1-year predictions, $0.0010$ for 10-year predictions), indicating that \aladyn{} captures predictive signal rather than reverse causation effects.

\paragraph*{Temporal Leakage Assessment: Multi-Year Washout.}
To address temporal misalignment between ICD-10 dates and true disease onset, we conducted two complementary analyses. First, we compared 10-year predictions made at enrollment with versus without excluding the first year of outcomes following enrollment. This analysis (Panel B) demonstrates robustness to excluding the first year of outcomes, with minimal performance degradation (e.g., ASCVD AUC $= 0.723$ with 1-year exclusion vs $0.733$ baseline). Second, we evaluated 1-year predictions at fixed timepoints (enrollment+1 through enrollment+9 years) using models trained with different washout periods (0, 1, or 2 years). For each prediction timepoint $t_{pred} \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\}$, we trained models using data up to $t_{pred} - w$ years, where $w \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ represents the washout period. This analysis (Panel C) tests for temporal information leakage by varying the amount of training data available, demonstrating substantial residual predictive power even with 1–2-year washout periods across key diseases.


All analyses were performed using Python, with survival models implemented in lifelines and scikit-survival, and validated in R (Version 4.0) using the Survival package,  and calibration and discrimination metrics computed using standard epidemiological methods.

\end{itemize}
The website displays only synthetic data (slightly modified UK Biobank data for individual examples) and does not provide access to individual-level model parameters or allow reverse engineering of the UK Biobank model parameter matrices, which remain protected under data sharing policies.

\item \textbf{Permanent archive:} A versioned release of all code, summary statistics, and supplementary data files will be archived on Zenodo (DOI to be assigned upon acceptance) to ensure long-term accessibility.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Biobank data access:} Individual-level data from UK Biobank, Mass General Brigham Biobank, and All of Us are available through their respective access procedures due to data use agreements and patient privacy protections. However, our publicly shared summary statistics, aggregated results, and code enable researchers to apply our methods to other cohorts and conduct meta-analyses without requiring access to the original biobank data.

We have updated the Data Availability statement in the manuscript to comprehensively reflect these commitments. All publicly shared resources contain only aggregated or de-identified information in compliance with institutional IRB approvals and data use agreements.

(\textbf{A}) Phi trajectories for five representative diseases across all 40 training subsets. For each disease-signature pair (myocardial infarction–Signature 5, breast cancer–Signature 19, type 2 diabetes–Signature 15, atrial fibrillation–Signature 0, depression–Signature 7), the plot shows trajectories from all subsets (gray lines), the mean across subsets (blue line), the master checkpoint estimate (red dashed line), and standard error bands (light blue shading). 
(\textbf{B}) Distribution of standard errors across all $\phi$ parameters: (top) histogram on linear scale with mean and median indicated, (middle) histogram on log scale, (bottom) cumulative distribution with 95th percentile marked. The very small standard errors (mean SE = 0.0010, median SE = 0.0002, 95\% of values $\leq$ 0.004) demonstrate the stability of $\phi$ estimation across subsets and confirm that disease signatures represent replicable biological patterns rather than subset-specific noise.}

    \caption{\textbf{$\aladyn$} 
    (\textbf{A}) \textit{Joint analysis (Figures 2-4):} UK Biobank training data (400k individuals) divided into 40 subsets of 10k each, with one subset held out for testing. Disease-signature associations ($\hat{\phi}$) and individual loadings ($\hat{\lambda}$) estimated on each of the 39 training subsets using complete disease trajectories, then averaged: $\phi_{\text{fixed train}} = \frac{1}{39} \sum_{b=1}^{39} \phi^{(b)}$. The held-out test set is never used for $\phi$ estimation, ensuring no data leakage. Genetic validation performed using models with genetic mean effects removed ($\Gamma_k = 0$).
    (\textbf{B}) \textit{Prospective Analysis:} Rigorous prediction evaluation using the held-out test set (10k individuals) with fixed $\phi_{\text{fixed train}}$ parameters. Individual loadings ($\hat{\lambda}_{\text{test}}$) re-estimated using only data available up to each prediction time point through temporal censoring. This approach prevents data leakage and simulates real-world clinical scenarios where population-level disease patterns are known but individual risk trajectories must be estimated prospectively from available clinical history.
    (\textbf{C}) \textit{Cross-Population Validation:} Independent estimation of disease signatures in Mass General Brigham (MGB) and All of Us (AOU) cohorts demonstrates reproducibility across different populations and healthcare systems. Each cohort yields cohort-specific $\phi$ and $\psi$ parameters, with strong correlation between cohorts confirming biological validity rather than population-specific artifacts. This cross-population validation strengthens confidence in the universal applicability of discovered disease signatures (see Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_correspondence}).
(\textbf{D}) \textit{Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation:} Robustness validation of the pooled $\phi$ approach by excluding one batch at a time and comparing predictions using leave-one-out $\phi$ estimates versus full pooled $\phi$ estimates. The analysis evaluates static 10-year and dynamic 10-year AUC comparisons across all 40 batches. Results demonstrate excellent robustness: predictions showed near-perfect correlation (r = 0.995) with master predictions, mean AUC differences were $\leq$ 0.0001, maximum differences were $\leq$ 0.0015, and 99.6-100\% of comparisons fell within a 0.01 AUC threshold. The scatter plot (bottom-right) shows LOO AUCs versus full pooled AUCs clustering tightly along the y=x line, confirming that excluding any single batch has negligible impact on predictive performance. This validation confirms that no single batch dominates the pooled $\phi$ estimates and that the full pooled approach generalizes well across all batches.}

        (\textbf{A}) \textit{Raw Latent Loadings:} The model estimates individual-specific  loadings $\hat{\lambda} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times K \times T}$ for N=400,000 individuals across K=21 signatures and T=52 timepoints (ages 30-81). 
        (\textbf{B}) \textit{Signature Weights:} Raw loadings are transformed via softmax to obtain normalized signature loadings $\theta \in [0,1]^{N \times K \times T}$, where $\sum_k \theta_{ik}(t) = 1$ for each individual and timepoint, representing the probability distribution across signatures.
        (\textbf{C}) \textit{Individual Signature Trajectories:} Left panel shows example temporal trajectories for different signatures (cardiovascular, cancer, metabolic, musculoskeletal) illustrating distinct age-related patterns. Right panel demonstrates patient heterogeneity within a single signature, showing how genetic and environmental factors lead to different AEX values across individuals.
        (\textbf{D}) \textit{AEX Matrix:} The area under each individual's signature trajectory is computed as $\text{AEX}_{ik} = \int_{30}^{80} \theta_{ik}(t) \, dt$, yielding a quantitative phenotype matrix $\text{AEX} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times K}$ where each entry represents individual $i$'s lifetime exposure to signature $k$. This matrix serves as the input for genome-wide association studies to identify genetic variants influencing signature-specific disease risk patterns.}

\caption{\textbf{Cross-cohort validation demonstrates robust disease signature replicability.} 
(\textbf{A}) Heatmaps showing the correspondence between \aladyn{} disease signatures (clusters) across cohorts, focusing on diseases common to all three biobanks. Each cell represents the proportion of diseases from a UK Biobank (UKB) signature that map to the corresponding signature in Mass General Brigham (MGB, left panel) or All of Us (AoU, right panel). Darker red indicates stronger correspondence. UKB clusters are ordered by their best-matching cluster in each validation cohort to highlight the diagonal pattern of correspondence. 
(\textbf{B}) Composition preservation probability calculation for each UKB signature. Disease-to-signature assignments are determined using posterior fitting (the signature with maximum posterior association strength, $\text{argmax}_k(\psi_{kd})$ for each disease). For each UKB cluster, we identified the best-matching cluster in the comparison cohort (MGB or AoU) by finding the cluster with maximum intersection size relative to the UKB cluster size. The composition preservation probability index is calculated as the proportion of diseases in a UKB signature that also belong to its best-matching signature in the other cohort (i.e., the intersection size divided by the UKB signature size, rather than the traditional Jaccard intersection-over-union). The analysis reveals high cross-cohort replicability, with a median composition preservation probability of 0.80 (IQR: 0.667, 0.964) across both validation cohorts, indicating that 80\% of diseases within each UKB signature are consistently grouped together in the corresponding signature in independent healthcare systems. This demonstrates that disease signatures identified in UK Biobank are consistently reproduced in independent populations, confirming biological validity rather than population-specific artifacts.}

(\textbf{Bottom panel}) Time-averaged signature contributions showing the overall signature profile for each patient, summarizing the relative importance of different biological pathways in their disease history. Patients are selected to demonstrate increasing complexity of disease profiles, from simpler single-signature patterns to complex multi-signature interactions involving 30+ diseases across multiple biological pathways. Colors are consistent across panels and represent the primary signature assignment for each diagnosed condition, enabling visual tracking of how signature loadings change in response to new diagnoses and how multiple signatures can contribute simultaneously to a patient's disease risk.}

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{paper_figs/supp/S7.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Signature-specific SNP associations reveal pleiotropic genetic effects.}
    For each \aladyn{} disease signature, we identified lead genetic variants (SNPs) from GWAS of the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of normalized signature loadings ($\theta$) across individuals. We then tested each lead SNP for association with a broad set of component disease phenotypes using logistic regression, adjusting for sex and ancestry principal components. The heatmap displays association strength ($-\log_{10}(P)$) for lead SNPs from each signature across constituent disease phenotypes, with significance ($P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$) indicated. The full matrix enables identification of signature-specific loci---variants associated with the signature but not with any single constituent disease. These results reveal pleiotropic genetic effects that are captured by the multi-disease signature but are not apparent in single-disease GWAS.}

This static prediction approach (using enrollment-time predictions for a fixed 10-year horizon) is not the optimal way to use \aladyn{}, as we recommend dynamic updates that incorporate new information at each time point; however, we show this comparison for direct comparability with PREVENT, which predicts for a fixed 10-year horizon. The similar performance of \aladyn{} in males and females (AUC 0.712 vs 0.710) contrasts with the sex-specific differences observed in PREVENT, where the gap between Aladynoulli and PREVENT is larger for males (difference +0.097) than for females (difference +0.045). \cite{ambrosio_performance_2025}}

For each disease, patients were first identified and then clustered into three subgroups using k-means clustering applied to their time-averaged normalized signature loadings ($\bar{\theta}_{ik} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_t \theta_{ikt}$), where $\theta_{ikt}$ represents patient $i$'s normalized association with signature $k$ at time $t$ (see \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:individual_trajectories}C} for visualization of these illustrative clusters).

Aladynoulli achieves higher AUC than Delphi for 15 out of 28 diseases (53.6\%), with a mean advantage of +0.0344. Color indicates the advantage (Aladynoulli AUC - Delphi AUC), with green indicating Aladynoulli advantage and red/orange indicating Delphi advantage.}

   \caption{\textbf{Three-way validation of rare variant associations: signature-gene, gene-disease, and disease-signature consistency.} To validate rare variant associations through an independent pathway, we examined the three-way consistency between signature-gene associations (from RVAS), gene-disease correlations (from rare variant burden association with diseases), and disease-signature loadings (from $\phi$ parameters). For each signature-gene pair identified through RVAS, we tested whether diseases with high rare variant burden in that gene also showed high signature loading. Each scatter plot shows gene-disease rare variant burden correlations (x-axis) versus maximum signature-disease association over time transformed to probability scale via sigmoid ($\text{sigmoid}(\max_t \phi_{kdt})$, y-axis) for diseases with statistically significant gene-disease correlations (p $<$ 0.05). (\textbf{Top-left}) Signature 0 - TTN: r = 0.535, $p = 6.7×10^{-17}$. TTN encodes titin, a key cardiac structural protein, and shows strong associations with cardiomyopathies and arrythmias. (\textbf{Top-right}) Signature 5  - LDLR: r = 0.743, $p = 7.1x10^{-34}$. LDLR shows the strongest three-way consistency, with diseases like hypercholesterolemia, coronary atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction showing both high LDLR rare variant burden and high Signature 5 loading. (\textbf{Bottom-left}) Signature 6 - BRCA2: r = 0.496, p = $7.1 x 10^{-16}$. BRCA2 shows strong associations with secondary malignancies, particularly metastatic cancers of lymph nodes, liver, and bone, validating that Signature 6 captures cancer progression pathways. (\textbf{Bottom-right}) Signature 10 (ophthalmologic) - MIP: r = 0.577, p = $1.1x10^{-19}$. MIP shows strong associations with eye diseases including cataracts, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. The high correlations across these three measures demonstrate consistency in co-association patterns, suggesting that the rare genetic basis of signatures is reflected in both gene-disease and signature-disease relationships, without implying causal directionality.}

This tests whether predictions rely on diagnostic cascades immediately preceding enrollment. (\textbf{B}) \textit{Time horizon}: Exclude events in the first year after enrollment, then make 10-year predictions. This evaluates robustness to excluding the first year of outcomes. (\textbf{C}) \textit{Temporal leakage}: Fix prediction timepoint and train models using data up to different timepoints (prediction-0, prediction-1, or prediction-2 years), then make 1-year predictions. This tests for temporal information leakage by varying the amount of training data available.

For each signature, GWAS was performed on the area-under-the-curve (AEX) phenotype, defined as the lifetime signature exposure for each individual (integrated signature loadings over time: $\text{AEX}_{ik} = \int \theta_{ik}(t) \, dt$). LDSC was then applied to compute genetic correlations between each signature's GWAS summary statistics and external trait GWAS summary statistics from published studies. The heatmap shows signatures (rows) versus external traits (columns), with color intensity representing the genetic correlation $r_g$ (red: positive correlation, blue: negative correlation, white: no correlation). Strong positive correlations (dark red) indicate shared genetic architecture between a signature and an external trait, demonstrating that signatures capture biologically meaningful genetic risk factors with pleiotropic effects across related conditions. For example, the cardiovascular signature (Signature 5) shows strong positive correlations with external cardiovascular trait GWAS (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia), validating that this signature captures genuine cardiovascular genetic risk. Similarly, the metabolic/diabetes signature shows strong correlations with type 2 diabetes GWAS, while signatures show expected depletion (blue/white) for unrelated traits, confirming the biological specificity of each signature. These genetic correlations provide independent validation that disease signatures represent distinct biological pathways with shared genetic architectures, rather than statistical artifacts, and demonstrate the utility of signature-based phenotypes for understanding pleiotropic genetic effects across related conditions.}

\caption{\textbf{Cross-cohort validation of deviation-based pathway discovery for myocardial infarction.} To further demonstrate biological heterogeneity within disease categories, we performed a supplementary pathway analysis using deviation-from-reference clustering, which complements our main analysis based on average signature loadings (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:individual_trajectories}C}). For each patient with myocardial infarction, we computed signature deviations from the population reference over the 10-year window preceding their MI event: $\delta_{ik}(t) = \theta_{ik}(t) - \bar{\theta}_k(t)$, where $\theta_{ik}(t)$ is patient $i$'s signature $k$ loading at age $t$ and $\bar{\theta}_k(t)$ is the population mean signature $k$ loading at age $t$. We then applied k-means clustering (k=4) to these deviation vectors (210 features: 21 signatures × 10 timepoints), identifying four illustrative pathways that represent distinct biological routes to MI: Pathway 0 (7.4\% of patients, n=1,836 UKB), Pathway 1 (44.8\%, n=11,108), Pathway 2 (17.9\%, n=4,439), and Pathway 3 (29.9\%, n=7,420). These pathways are illustrative examples of heterogeneity rather than definitive categories, demonstrating how patients with the same diagnosis can follow distinct biological trajectories.

Signature 5 (cardiovascular, bright green) consistently shows strong positive deviations, particularly in Pathways 0 and 3, with peak deviations around age 60-70 years. The consistent patterns across independent cohorts validate that these deviation-based pathways capture reproducible biological heterogeneity rather than cohort-specific artifacts.}

\caption{\textbf{Temporal signature deviation trajectories for rheumatoid arthritis patients who develop myocardial infarction.} This analysis demonstrates how signature deviations from population reference differ between RA patients who develop MI (cases) versus those who do not (controls), comparing UK Biobank (UKB) and Mass General Brigham (MGB) cohorts. For each patient with rheumatoid arthritis, signature deviations were computed as $\delta_{ik}(t) = \theta_{ik}(t) - \bar{\theta}_k(t)$ over the 10-year window preceding their MI event (or matched timepoint for controls), where $\theta_{ik}(t)$ represents patient $i$'s signature $k$ loading at age $t$ and $\bar{\theta}_k(t)$ is the population mean. Mean deviations were then calculated separately for RA patients who developed MI versus RA patients who did not, for each signature and timepoint within the 10-year pre-event window. The plots show how signature deviations evolve over this pre-event period, with Signature 5 (cardiovascular, shown as a prominent colored line) exhibiting a pronounced positive deviation increase leading up to MI in both cohorts, while remaining relatively flat in RA patients who do not develop MI. This cross-cohort validation demonstrates that signature deviation patterns are reproducible across independent healthcare systems and coding practices, confirming that signature-based pathway identification captures fundamental biological variation in disease progression trajectories. The analysis serves as an illustrative example of how signature deviations can reveal distinct biological pathways leading to the same endpoint (MI) within a high-risk population (RA patients), demonstrating the model's ability to identify heterogeneous progression patterns even among patients sharing both an initial condition (RA) and a subsequent outcome (MI).}

\caption{LDSC heritability estimates for component CVD traits on both observed and liability scales. 
\textbf{Key point:} Because our signatures are continuous phenotypes, they can only be measured on the observed scale. Therefore, the observed-scale heritabilities (h$^2_{\text{obs}}$ $\approx$ 0.03--0.05) shown here are the appropriate comparison for Signature 5 ($h^2$ = 0.0414)---and Signature 5 meets or exceeds these values.
Liability-scale estimates are provided solely for comparison with literature values, which typically report heritability on this scale 
(e.g., Neale Lab reports coronary atherosclerosis h$^2_{\text{liability}}$ = 0.16, h$^2_{\text{observed}}$ = 0.03; 
\url{https://nealelab.github.io/UKBB_ldsc/h2_summary_I9_CORATHER.html}).
Conversion uses the formula from Lee et al. 2011: 
$h^2_l = h^2_o \cdot K^2(1-K)^2 / [z^2 \cdot P(1-P)]$, 
where $K$ is population prevalence, $P$ is sample prevalence, and $z$ is the standard normal density at the liability threshold. Following standard practice when population prevalence is unknown, we assume $K = P$.}
