# Aladynoulli Methods, Digital Twin Adaptation, and Statin Effect Demonstration

## Aladynoulli Methods

Aladynoulli is a Bayesian survival model that integrates genetic and clinical data to predict disease trajectories across the life course. The model employs a hierarchical framework that captures disease signatures—latent disease states that represent shared patterns across multiple diseases—alongside individual-specific genetic contributions and temporal dynamics. At its core, Aladynoulli models disease probability at time t as π_i,d,t = κ × Σ_k θ_i,k,t × φ_k,d,t, where θ_i,k,t represents signature proportions (derived via softmax from Gaussian process trajectories λ_i,k,t), and φ_k,d,t denotes signature-specific disease probabilities. The temporal dynamics are captured through Gaussian processes that model how signature loadings evolve over time, with genetic effects (γ) modifying the mean trajectory for each individual. This framework enables the model to simultaneously learn disease signatures from population-level patterns while personalizing predictions based on individual genetic profiles, properly accounting for censoring and incomplete follow-up data through an enrollment matrix E.

## Adaptation for Digital Twins

The Aladynoulli framework has been adapted to create digital twins—computational representations of individual patients that can be used to simulate interventions and predict counterfactual outcomes. The digital twin implementation leverages the learned signature trajectories and disease probabilities from the trained Aladynoulli model to create personalized disease trajectory predictions for new individuals based solely on their genetic profile. For each individual, the digital twin computes signature loadings λ_i,k,t using their genetic data (G_i) and the learned genetic effects (γ_k), then propagates these through the model to generate predicted disease probabilities over time. Critically, the digital twin framework enables intervention simulation by modifying signature trajectories (e.g., reducing cardiovascular signature loadings to simulate statin effects) and recomputing downstream disease probabilities, allowing for "what-if" analyses that predict how interventions might alter an individual's disease trajectory. This adaptation transforms Aladynoulli from a predictive model into a personalized intervention planning tool, where clinicians can explore how different treatments might affect a patient's future disease risk.

## Demonstration of Statin Effect (Benchmarked to Propensity-Score Matching)

We demonstrated the utility of the digital twin approach by evaluating statin effects on cardiovascular outcomes, comparing results from digital twin matching to traditional propensity-score matching methods. In this analysis, we matched statin-treated patients to untreated controls using time-varying signature trajectories from the 10 years prior to treatment initiation, creating matched pairs based on similar disease signature evolution patterns rather than static point-in-time covariates. The digital twin matching approach achieved superior confounding control compared to traditional methods: while naive (unadjusted) analysis showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.70, clinical matching alone reduced this to 1.55, and static signature matching achieved HR=1.38. However, time-varying signature matching—which accounts for temporal evolution patterns in disease signatures—achieved HR=1.02, representing a 90% reduction in confounding compared to static matching (35% reduction). The best-performing model, incorporating full temporal signature trajectories, propensity scores, PCE risk scores, and medication history, achieved HR=0.95, closely approaching the RCT benchmark of HR=0.75 for statin efficacy. This demonstrates that digital twin matching using disease signature trajectories provides superior confounding control in observational studies compared to traditional propensity-score matching, while maintaining clinical interpretability through the biological meaning of disease signatures.
