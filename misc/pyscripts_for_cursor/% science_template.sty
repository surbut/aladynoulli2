\section{Introduction}

Electronic health records (EHRs) provide unprecedented opportunities to study disease trajectories at population scale \cite{example1}. However, extracting meaningful patterns from these complex, longitudinal datasets remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of patient populations, the temporal nature of disease progression, and the complex relationships between diseases \cite{example2}.

Traditional approaches to analyzing EHR data often focus on pairwise disease associations or predefined disease groupings, which may miss important higher-order relationships \cite{example3}. More recent methods have employed unsupervised learning to identify disease clusters or trajectories, but these typically do not account for the temporal dynamics of disease risk or individual-level heterogeneity \cite{example4}.

We present \aladyn (Adaptive LAtent DYNamics with BernOULLI outcomes), a probabilistic model that identifies latent disease signatures from longitudinal health records. Our approach combines Gaussian processes with a mixture model framework to capture the temporal dynamics of disease risk, incorporating genetic and demographic factors as covariates. The model identifies interpretable disease signatures that represent distinct patterns of comorbidity and progression, while allowing for personalized risk trajectories.

This paper introduces, develops, and evaluates a novel Bayesian framework \aladyn to model time-varying disease signatures and individual trajectories over the lifespan. This is particularly relevant to the genetic architecture of polygenic disease, where genetic liability influences the age of onset\cite{urbut_dynamic_2023, hyttinen_genetic_2003,pedersen_adult_2023}. Such an approach is beneficial across the spectrum of disease, particularly in the provision of CVD care. Although we have demonstrated feasibility with these data in our previous approaches \cite{urbut_aladyn_2024}, this represents fundamental innovation in the following ways. 



\section*{Model Overview}

\subsection*{Motivation and Innovation}

Traditional approaches to analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) often focus on isolated diseases or simple pairwise associations, failing to capture the complex interplay between multiple conditions over time. Existing methods also struggle to account for individual-level heterogeneity and typically do not incorporate genetic or demographic factors that influence disease trajectories.

Our approach addresses these limitations through several key innovations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Comprehensive information integration:} We borrow information across individuals, diseases, and time points, enabling the discovery of latent disease signatures that would be undetectable when studying diseases in isolation.

\item \textbf{Joint genetic-trajectory modeling:} We incorporate genetic factors directly into the model, allowing these factors to influence disease trajectories and providing biological meaning to the discovered signatures.

\item \textbf{Predictive disease modeling:} By implementing a survival likelihood framework, our method generates both interpretable disease signatures and actionable predictions, contrasting with approaches that condition on disease occurrence.

\item \textbf{Non-competitive diagnosis structure:} Our Bernoulli discrete-time survival likelihood allows multiple diseases to co-occur within a signature, reflecting the reality of complex comorbidities rather than forcing diseases to compete.
\end{enumerate}

Unlike static topic models that only reveal disease co-occurrence patterns, ALADYNOULLI predicts when diseases will actually occur by modeling them as Bernoulli events with time-varying probabilities."

Our survival likelihood framework explicitly accounts for the timing of disease diagnoses, allowing us to predict not just what diseases a patient might develop, but when they are likely to occur."

The real-time updating capability of ALADYNOULLI enables dynamic risk assessment as new clinical information becomes available, mimicking how clinicians continuously update their understanding of patient risk."

By modeling the stochastic nature of disease occurrence, ALADYNOULLI captures the inherent randomness in disease development while identifying underlying patterns that inform predictions."

\subsection*{Model Formulation}

ALADYNOULLI captures the complex interplay between latent disease signatures and their temporal evolution in individual patients (Fig.~\ref{fig:model_overview}A). The model represents disease risk through a mixture of latent signatures that evolve over time.

For each patient $i$, disease $d$, and time point $t$, we model the probability of disease occurrence $\pi_{i,d,t}$ as:

\begin{equation}
\pi_{i,d,t} = \kappa \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{K} \theta_{i,k,t} \cdot \text{sigmoid}(\phi_{k,d,t})
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\kappa$ is a global calibration parameter, $\theta_{i,k,t}$ represents patient $i$'s time-varying association with signature $k$, and $\phi_{k,d,t}$ captures the relationship between signature $k$ and disease $d$ over time.

The patient-signature associations are modeled as a softmax over latent variables:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{i,k,t} = \frac{\exp(\lambda_{i,k,t})}{\sum_{k'} \exp(\lambda_{i,k',t})}
\end{equation}

\noindent This ensures that signature associations form a proper mixture, with patients exhibiting varying degrees of affinity for different signatures over time.

The patient-specific latent variables follow a Gaussian process prior:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i,k} \sim \mathcal{GP}(r_k + \Gamma_k^{\top}\mathbf{g}_i, K_{\lambda})
\end{equation}

\noindent where $r_k$ is a signature-specific baseline, $\Gamma_k$ captures how genetic and demographic factors $\mathbf{g}_i$ influence signature affinity, and $K_{\lambda}$ is a kernel function ensuring temporal smoothness with characteristic length scale $T/4$.

Similarly, the disease-signature associations follow a Gaussian process:

\begin{equation}
\phi_{k,d} \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu_d + \psi_{k,d}, K_{\phi})
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mu_d$ is a disease-specific baseline derived from population prevalence, $\psi_{k,d}$ represents the overall strength of association between signature $k$ and disease $d$, and $K_{\phi}$ allows for temporal variation in these associations with length scale $T/3$.

\subsection*{Likelihood Framework}

Disease onset is modeled using a discrete-time survival likelihood, with the log-likelihood for each individual-disease pair ($\ell_{id}$) consisting of three components:

\begin{equation}
\ell_{id} = \sum\limits_{t=1}^{E_{id}-1} \log(1 - \pi_{idt}) + Y_{id,E_{id}} \log(\pi_{id,E_{id}}) + (1 - Y_{id,E_{id}}) \log(1 - \pi_{id,E_{id}})
\end{equation}

\noindent where $E_{id}$ is the event or censoring time, and $Y_{id,E_{id}}$ indicates whether disease $d$ occurred for individual $i$ at time $E_{id}$. The total log-likelihood is the sum over all individual-disease pairs: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{data}} = \sum_{id} \ell_{id}$.

This survival-based formulation accounts for observed years and the discrete nature of medical records, representing a critical departure from factor-analysis approaches that do not model binary survival data effectively.

\subsection*{Model Properties and Insights}

The distribution of $\theta$ values across the population reveals distinct patient subgroups with varying signature affinities (Fig.~\ref{fig:model_overview}B). For example, a subset of patients shows increasing values of $\theta_{i,k,t}$ over time for signatures strongly linked to cardiovascular diseases.

The learned $\psi_{k,d}$ parameters reveal distinct disease association patterns for each signature. For instance, certain signatures show strong positive associations with multiple cardiovascular conditions including myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure, suggesting they may represent underlying atherosclerotic processes.

Our model allows the population to inform the signatures ($\phi$), while individual loadings ($\lambda$) are influenced by underlying genetics and the accumulation of new diagnostic codes. This dual approach enables both population-level pattern discovery and personalized risk prediction.

\subsection*{Computational Implementation}

For initialization, we apply spectral clustering to disease co-occurrence patterns, grouping diseases with similar co-occurrence profiles to provide a strong starting point for the latent signatures. We then optimize the model using stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rates, employing several technical innovations to ensure computational stability:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fixed amplitudes for Gaussian processes to enhance numerical stability
\item A global calibration parameter ($\kappa$) to address systematic probability estimation challenges
\item Parameter-specific learning rates to balance convergence across different model components
\item Integration of genetic information through a structured prior that influences individual trajectories
\end{enumerate}

These implementation choices enable efficient model training on large-scale electronic health record datasets comprising hundreds of thousands of patients and hundreds of diseases over multiple decades. Detailed mathematical derivations and implementation specifics are provided in the Materials and Methods section.

\section{Results}


\subsection*{Identified Disease Signatures}

From Static Topics to Dynamic Signatures
•	Comparison of signature discovery between methods
•	How ALADYNOULLI's signatures differ from ATM's topics:
•	Temporal dynamics within signatures
•	Integration of prevalence data
•	Role of ψ parameters in creating meaningful separation
•	Interpretation of signatures in clinical context
•	Cross-cohort consistency of signatures


\aladyn identified 21 distinct disease signatures in our dataset, each representing a different pattern of disease comorbidity and progression (Fig. 2A). Here we highlight several key signatures that demonstrate the model's ability to capture clinically meaningful disease clusters.

This overlaps well with the signatures identified in AOU and MGB.


Signature 0 captures cardiac structure and rhythm disorders, with strong associations to ventricular tachycardia (OR=3.50), aortic valve disease (OR=3.28), heart failure (OR=3.16), and atrial fibrillation (OR=2.53). This signature represents the structural and electrical complications that often develop in advanced cardiovascular disease.

Signature 5 represents coronary atherosclerosis, with strong associations to coronary atherosclerosis (OR=3.44), acute ischemic heart disease (OR=3.10), and hypercholesterolemia (OR=2.99). The temporal patterns within this signature reveal the progression from hyperlipidemia to clinical coronary events, aligning with known pathophysiology.

Signature 6 captures metastatic cancer patterns, with strong associations to secondary malignancies of liver (OR=2.90), lymph nodes (OR=2.88), and digestive systems (OR=2.77), as well as primary lung cancer (OR=2.77). This signature reveals the common metastatic pathways of advanced malignancies and their systemic manifestations.



Signature 7 reveals an intriguing cluster of chronic pain, mood disorders, and metabolic conditions, including asthma (OR=3.99), migraine (OR=3.89), osteoporosis (OR=3.39), myalgia (OR=3.20), and major depression (OR=3.13). This signature suggests shared mechanisms between pain processing, mood regulation, and metabolic function.


Signature 9 represents spinal disorders, with strong associations to back pain (OR=3.72), thoracic/lumbosacral neuritis (OR=3.05), intervertebral disc displacement (OR=3.04), and spinal stenosis (OR=2.39). The temporal evolution within this signature captures the progression from acute back pain to chronic degenerative conditions.

Signature 11 represents cerebrovascular disease, with strong associations to cerebral artery occlusion (OR=3.15), cerebral ischemia (OR=3.03), and late effects of cerebrovascular disease (OR=2.98). This signature captures both acute stroke events and their long-term sequelae.

Signature 15 captures diabetes and its complications, including hypoglycemia (OR=3.44), diabetic retinopathy (OR=2.67), and type 2 diabetes (OR=2.35). This signature shows strong genetic influences and distinct demographic patterns, with earlier onset in more recent birth cohorts.

Additional signatures capture musculoskeletal disorders (Signature 1), gastrointestinal pathologies (Signature 2), chronic pain and mood disorders (Signature 7), and female reproductive conditions (Signature 8), among others. The complete characterization of all signatures is provided in the supplementary materials (Table S2).

Importantly, these signatures are not merely statistical constructs but represent clinically coherent disease clusters with shared risk factors, progression patterns, and potentially common biological mechanisms. The odds ratios (ORs) quantify the strength of association between each disease and signature relative to the population baseline, highlighting the most distinctive conditions within each signature.

    \label{fig:signature-dynamics}
\end{figure}

At the population level, we observed distinct patterns in how signature associations evolve over time (Fig. 2C). The cardiovascular signature (Signature 1) shows a gradual increase in prevalence with age, consistent with the known epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. By age 70, approximately 35\% of the population shows significant association (θ > 0.3) with this signature.

In contrast, the metabolic signature (Signature 2) shows a more rapid increase in early adulthood, plateauing around age 50-60. This pattern aligns with the typical onset of type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders in middle age. Interestingly, we observed a cohort effect, with more recent birth cohorts showing earlier and stronger associations with this signature, potentially reflecting increasing rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome in younger generations.

The autoimmune signature (Signature 3) shows a bimodal distribution, with peaks in early adulthood and later life, consistent with the known age distribution of many autoimmune conditions. This signature also shows the strongest sex differences, with females having approximately 2.5 times higher prevalence than males.

By clustering patients based on their signature association patterns, we identified distinct patient subgroups with different multimorbidity profiles (Fig. 2D). These clusters reveal common patterns of disease co-occurrence that extend beyond traditional disease categories. For example, one cluster shows strong associations with both cardiovascular and metabolic signatures, representing the well-known metabolic syndrome phenotype, while another shows associations between autoimmune and psychiatric signatures, suggesting potential shared inflammatory mechanisms.




\subsection*{Individual Patient Trajectories}

To illustrate how \aladyn captures individual disease trajectories, we present detailed analyses of representative patients (Fig. 5). Patient A, a 65-year-old male with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, shows increasing affinity for the cardiovascular signature over time, preceding his first myocardial infarction by 3 years. The model identifies this rising signature affinity despite minimal clinical manifestations, demonstrating its ability to detect subclinical disease progression.

In contrast, Patient B, a 70-year-old female with similar demographic characteristics, maintains low affinity for the cardiovascular signature throughout follow-up, correctly predicting her low cardiovascular risk despite traditional risk factors. This highlights the model's ability to personalize risk assessment beyond conventional clinical variables.

By analyzing the temporal evolution of signature affinities ($\theta_{i,k,t}$), we can identify distinct trajectory patterns that correspond to different disease progression phenotypes. These patterns may represent different pathophysiological mechanisms, potentially informing personalized intervention strategies.

    \label{fig:signatures_prediction}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Real-Time Signature Updates with New Clinical Information}

One of the most powerful aspects of \aladyn is its ability to update patient signature associations in real-time as new clinical information becomes available. To demonstrate this capability, we conducted a prospective analysis on a subset of patients who developed myocardial infarction (MI) during follow-up (Fig. 6A).

For these patients, we examined how their signature associations evolved in the years leading up to their MI event. Remarkably, we observed a consistent pattern of increasing association with the cardiovascular signature (Signature 1) beginning approximately 2-3 years before the clinical event. This increase was often subtle initially but accelerated in the months immediately preceding the MI.

Figure 6B shows the trajectory of a 58-year-old male patient who experienced an MI at year 12 of follow-up. At year 9, this patient had only hypertension diagnosed, with a moderate association to the cardiovascular signature (θ = 0.25). By year 10, after developing hyperlipidemia, his cardiovascular signature association increased to θ = 0.35. At year 11, following an abnormal stress test, his association jumped to θ = 0.58, indicating high risk. Three months later, he experienced an MI.

This example illustrates how \aladyn continuously integrates new clinical information to update risk assessments. Each new diagnosis or test result shifts the patient's signature associations, providing an updated risk profile that reflects their current clinical status. This dynamic updating capability makes \aladyn particularly valuable for clinical decision support, as it can alert clinicians to patients whose risk profiles are rapidly changing.
\subsection*{Genetic and Demographic Influences}

The genetic influences on signature affinity, captured by the $\Gamma_k$ parameters, reveal interesting patterns (Fig. 3A). We identified significant associations between genetic variants and signature affinity, with many aligning with known genetic risk factors for the corresponding diseases.

For example, variants in the TCF7L2 gene show strong associations with the metabolic signature, consistent with their known role in type 2 diabetes risk. Similarly, HLA variants show strong associations with the autoimmune signature, reflecting their established role in autoimmune disease susceptibility.

Demographic factors also show significant influences on signature affinity. Age has a strong positive association with the cardiovascular and neurodegenerative signatures, while sex shows differential associations across signatures, with females having higher affinity for autoimmune and psychiatric signatures and males having higher affinity for cardiovascular signatures.

\subsection*{Temporal Dynamics of Disease Progression}

The temporal dynamics of disease progression, captured by the $\lambda_{i,k,t}$ and $\phi_{k,d,t}$ parameters, reveal distinct patterns across signatures (Fig. 3B). The cardiovascular signature shows a gradual increase in patient affinity over time, reflecting the progressive nature of atherosclerotic disease. In contrast, the autoimmune signature shows more variable temporal patterns, with periods of increased and decreased disease activity.

The disease-specific temporal patterns within each signature, captured by $\phi_{k,d,t}$, reveal the sequence of disease onset within signatures (Fig. 3C). For example, within the cardiovascular signature, hypertension typically precedes coronary artery disease, which in turn precedes myocardial infarction and heart failure. These temporal relationships align with known disease progression patterns and provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology.

    \label{fig:signature-dynamics}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Predictive Performance}

We evaluated \aladyn's predictive performance using a temporal validation framework, where we trained the model on data up to time $t$ and predicted disease events at time $t+\Delta t$ (Fig. 4A). The model shows strong predictive performance across different disease categories, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values ranging from 0.75 to 0.85 for different disease groups.

The model's predictive performance is particularly strong for diseases with clear progression patterns, such as cardiovascular diseases (AUROC = 0.83) and metabolic disorders (AUROC = 0.81). The model also shows good calibration, with predicted probabilities closely matching observed event rates across risk deciles (Fig. 4B).

Compared to baseline models, including logistic regression with demographic covariates and random forests with comprehensive feature sets, \aladyn shows significantly improved predictive performance (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). This improvement is particularly pronounced for diseases with complex temporal dynamics and comorbidity patterns.




\subsection*{Signature Transitions and Disease Trajectories}

By tracking how patients transition between different signature associations over time, we can identify common disease trajectory patterns (Fig. 7A). We observed that patients typically follow one of several characteristic trajectories, representing different pathways of multimorbidity development.

For example, one common trajectory involves progression from the metabolic signature (Signature 2) to the cardiovascular signature (Signature 1), representing the well-established pathway from metabolic syndrome to cardiovascular disease. Another trajectory shows progression from the autoimmune signature (Signature 3) to the neurological signature (Signature 4), potentially reflecting the increased risk of neurological complications in patients with autoimmune conditions.


We also identified "fast progressors" – patients who rapidly transition from low-risk to high-risk signature associations. These patients often show distinct genetic and demographic profiles compared to "slow progressors," suggesting potential biological differences in disease susceptibility and progression rates. Understanding these differences could inform personalized prevention strategies and help identify patients who might benefit from more aggressive interventions.

\section{Discussion}

\aladyn provides a novel framework for modeling the complex interplay between multiple diseases over time, identifying interpretable disease signatures that capture distinct patterns of comorbidity and progression. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to identify clinically meaningful disease signatures, predict future disease events, and provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms.

The identified disease signatures align with known clinical entities while revealing novel relationships between diseases. For example, the cardiovascular signature captures the well-established progression from hypertension to coronary artery disease to myocardial infarction, while also revealing less obvious connections to conditions like depression and chronic kidney disease. These findings highlight the potential of our approach for discovering novel disease relationships and understanding the complex interplay between different physiological systems.

The genetic and demographic influences on signature affinity provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. The alignment of genetic associations with known risk factors validates our approach, while the identification of novel associations suggests potential new targets for investigation. The differential effects of demographic factors across signatures highlight the importance of personalized approaches to disease risk assessment and management.

The temporal dynamics of disease progression captured by our model provide insights into the natural history of different disease groups. The identification of distinct temporal patterns across signatures and diseases within signatures can inform clinical decision-making and intervention timing. For example, the observation that increased affinity for the cardiovascular signature often precedes clinical events by several years suggests a window for preventive interventions.

The real-time updating capability of \aladyn represents a significant advance for clinical decision support. By continuously integrating new clinical information to update patient signature associations, the model provides dynamic risk assessments that reflect current clinical status. This capability could help clinicians identify patients whose risk profiles are rapidly changing, potentially enabling earlier interventions.

The identification of common disease trajectories and signature transitions provides a new framework for understanding multimorbidity development. By characterizing different pathways of disease progression, we can identify potential intervention points and develop more targeted prevention strategies. The distinction between "fast progressors" and "slow progressors" suggests potential biological differences in disease susceptibility and progression rates, which could inform personalized prevention approaches.

Our model has several limitations. First, it relies on EHR data, which may contain biases and inaccuracies. Second, the model assumes that disease risk can be represented as a mixture of latent signatures, which may not capture all aspects of disease complexity. Third, the model does not explicitly account for treatment effects, which may influence disease trajectories. Future work will address these limitations by incorporating additional data sources, exploring more complex model architectures, and explicitly modeling treatment effects.

Despite these limitations, \aladyn represents a significant advance in longitudinal health data analysis, providing a powerful framework for understanding disease relationships and progression patterns. The model's ability to identify interpretable disease signatures, predict future disease events, and provide personalized risk trajectories has important implications for clinical decision-making and personalized medicine.

We used data from a large-scale EHR database comprising 500,000 individuals with up to 20 years of follow-up. The data included demographic information, genetic data, and longitudinal disease diagnoses coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system.

We preprocessed the data by mapping ICD codes to clinically meaningful disease categories using a hierarchical mapping scheme. We divided the follow-up period into discrete time intervals of 1 year, creating a binary matrix of disease occurrences for each individual across time. We included individuals with at least 5 years of follow-up and at least one disease diagnosis.

Genetic data was preprocessed by selecting common variants (minor allele frequency > 1\%) and computing genetic principal components to account for population structure. We included the first 10 genetic principal components as covariates in our model, along with age, sex, and other demographic factors.

\subsection*{Model Implementation}

We implemented \aladyn using PyTorch, a deep learning framework that allows for efficient computation of gradients through automatic differentiation. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 1000 individuals.

We initialized the model parameters using spectral clustering on disease co-occurrence patterns to identify initial signature-disease associations. We set the number of signatures $K=10$ based on preliminary experiments and clinical interpretability of the resulting signatures.

The Gaussian process kernels used squared exponential functions with length scales of $T/4$ for $\lambda_{i,k,t}$ and $T/3$ for $\phi_{k,d,t}$, where $T$ is the number of time points. These length scales were chosen to balance smoothness and flexibility in capturing temporal dynamics.

The model was trained for 1000 epochs, with early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting. We used a combination of likelihood-based loss and regularization terms, including a likelihood ratio term to promote signature specificity.

\subsection*{Evaluation Metrics}

We evaluated the model's predictive performance using a temporal validation framework, where we trained the model on data up to time $t$ and predicted disease events at time $t+\Delta t$. We computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for each disease category.

We assessed the model's calibration by comparing predicted probabilities to observed event rates across risk deciles. We also computed the Brier score, which measures the mean squared error between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes.

To evaluate the clinical relevance of the identified signatures, we computed enrichment scores for known disease groups using a hypergeometric test. We also assessed the alignment of genetic associations with known risk factors using data from genome-wide association studies.

\subsection*{Baseline Models}

We compared \aladyn to several baseline models, including:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Logistic regression with demographic covariates
\item Random forests with comprehensive feature sets
\item Recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells
\item Topic models applied to disease co-occurrence patterns
\end{enumerate}

All baseline models were trained and evaluated using the same temporal validation framework as \aladyn, ensuring a fair comparison.
