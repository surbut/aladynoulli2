# aladynoulli
Code for Solving Aladynoulli (or at least the best attempt)

In this repo, you'll find the main script for running (solvinglogit.R) and the sampler (mcmc_sampler_softmax) in the Rscripts directory.

Additional scripts related to useful functions ('utils'), model specific functions, initialization and sampling methods (for example, elliptical) are all in the utils directory.
