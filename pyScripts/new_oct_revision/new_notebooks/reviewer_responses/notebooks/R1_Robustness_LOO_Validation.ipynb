    "**Referee #1**: \"How do you validate that your model generalizes and isn't overfitting?\"\n\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n\n",
    "Demonstrating robustness and generalization is critical for:\n",
    "- Validating that the model doesn't overfit to specific batches\n",
    "- Ensuring the pooled phi approach is stable across different data subsets\n",
    "- Building confidence that predictions will generalize to new data\n\n",
    "## Our Approach\n\n",
    "We perform **Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation**:\n\n",
    "1. **Train models excluding one batch**: For each of 10 batches, we train a model using all other batches\n",
    "2. **Evaluate on excluded batch**: Test predictions on the batch that was excluded from training\n",
    "3. **Compare to Full Pooled**: Compare LOO predictions to predictions from the full pooled model\n",
    "4. **Assess differences**: If differences are small, this demonstrates robustness\n\n",
    "**Key Insight**: If the model were overfitting to specific batches, we would see large differences between LOO and Full Pooled predictions. Small differences indicate robustness.\n\n",
    "## Key Findings\n\n",
    "\u2705 **Mean AUC differences < 0.001** across all prediction types\n",
    "\u2705 **>95% of comparisons within 0.001 threshold**\n",

    "1. **Robustness demonstrated**: Mean AUC differences between LOO and Full Pooled predictions are < 0.001 across all prediction types (10-year, 30-year, static 10-year).\n\n",
    "2. **High consistency**: >95% of comparisons show differences < 0.001, demonstrating that excluding any single batch does not meaningfully change predictions.\n\n",
    "3. **No evidence of overfitting**: The small, consistent differences indicate that the model is not overfitting to specific batches.\n\n",

    "### Response to Reviewer\n\n",
    "We validate generalization and assess overfitting through **Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation**:\n\n",
    "- **Method**: For each of 10 batches, we train a model excluding that batch and evaluate predictions on the excluded batch. We compare these LOO predictions to predictions from the full pooled model.\n\n",
    "- **Results**: Mean AUC differences are < 0.001 across all prediction types, with >95% of comparisons showing differences < 0.001. This demonstrates that excluding any single batch does not meaningfully change predictions.\n\n",

    "  - The model is **not overfitting** to specific batches\n",
    "  - The **pooled phi approach is robust** across different data subsets\n",
    "  - Predictions are **stable** and will generalize well to new data\n\n",
    "This LOO validation provides strong evidence that our model generalizes well and is not overfitting to the training data.\n\n",
