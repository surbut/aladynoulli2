    "# R1: Clinical Utility - Dynamic Risk Updating\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewer Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Referee #1**: \"What is the clinical utility of this model? How would it be used in practice?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrating clinical utility is essential for:\n",
    "- Showing how the model would be used in real-world clinical practice\n",
    "- Understanding the value of updating predictions over time\n",
    "- Validating that dynamic risk assessment improves long-term predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate **dynamic risk updating** - a clinically realistic scenario where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Annual Updates**: Patients are seen annually, and risk predictions are updated each year\n",
    "2. **Rolling Predictions**: At each visit, we use the model trained with data up to that point\n",
    "3. **10-Year Risk Interpolation**: We compute cumulative 10-year risk using updated predictions\n",
    "4. **Comparison**: We compare dynamic (updated annually) vs. static (enrollment only) predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical Scenario**: This mirrors real-world practice where:\n",
    "- Patients have annual checkups\n",
    "- Risk assessments are updated based on new information\n",
    "- Long-term risk is estimated using the most current predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This analysis uses age_offset pi batches, which represent predictions made at enrollment + 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 years. Each year's prediction uses a model trained with data up to that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Dynamic risk updating improves discrimination** for 10-year risk prediction\n",
    "✅ **Annual updates capture evolving risk factors** and disease progression\n",
    "✅ **Clinically realistic approach** mirrors real-world practice\n",
    "⚠️ **Limitation**: Not a fully prospective evaluation (some temporal leakage)\n"

    "## 5. Summary and Response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic risk updating improves discrimination**: Annual updates improve 10-year risk prediction compared to static enrollment-only predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clinically realistic approach**: This mirrors real-world practice where patients are seen annually and risk assessments are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Captures evolving risk**: Annual updates allow the model to incorporate new information about disease progression and risk factor changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static Prediction (Enrollment Only)**:\n",
    "- Single risk assessment at enrollment\n",
    "- Does not incorporate new information\n",
    "- May become less accurate over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Prediction (Annual Updates)**:\n",
    "- Risk assessment updated annually\n",
    "- Incorporates new clinical information\n",
    "- Better reflects evolving patient risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response to Reviewer\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate clinical utility through **dynamic risk updating**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annual risk updates**: Patients are seen annually, and predictions are updated using models trained with data up to that point\n",
    "- **Improved discrimination**: Dynamic updates improve 10-year risk prediction compared to static enrollment-only predictions\n",
    "- **Clinically realistic**: This approach mirrors real-world practice where risk assessments evolve with new information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation**: This analysis is not a fully prospective evaluation, as each year's prediction uses a model trained with data up to that point (some temporal leakage). However, it demonstrates the clinical value of updating predictions over time.\n",
