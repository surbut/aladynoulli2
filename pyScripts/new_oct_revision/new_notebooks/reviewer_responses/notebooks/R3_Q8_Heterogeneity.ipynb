        "> \"We clarify our use of 'heterogeneity' as follows: (1) **Patient Heterogeneity**: Different individuals with the same disease diagnosis have different signature profiles (measured by average pairwise distance in signature space = 3.87). For example, two patients with CAD may have different metabolic vs. inflammatory signatures. (2) **Biological Heterogeneity**: Same clinical phenotype can arise from different biological pathways. For example, CAD can be driven by metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, or genetic factors. We demonstrate this through pathway analysis identifying 4 distinct pathways to myocardial infarction (progressive ischemia, hidden risk, inflammatory, metabolic). (3) **Disease Heterogeneity**: Umbrella term encompassing both patient and biological heterogeneity—the observation that 'CAD' is not a single entity but a collection of related conditions. Our model captures this through individual-specific signature loadings. We now consistently use these terms throughout the manuscript and define them in Methods.\"\n",
