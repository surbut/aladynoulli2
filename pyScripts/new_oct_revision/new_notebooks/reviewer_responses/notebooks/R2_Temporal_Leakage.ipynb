        "**Referee #2**: \"The authors claim on pg 13 to use a 'leakage-free validation strategy' by evaluating model performance at 30 timepoints. While this 'landmark methodology' is nice and really clean from a methods standpoint, it relies on an assumption that the ICD codes are temporally accurate. This assumption is very shaky. Indeed, we know that the first date of diagnosis for an ICD code can be much later than the actual date of diagnosis, in part due to EHR fragmentation and/or missing information.\"\n",

        "> \"We acknowledge the concern about temporal accuracy of ICD codes. To address potential leakage from diagnostic cascades, we implemented washout window analyses (0yr, 1yr, 2yr). Results show minimal performance degradation with 1-year washout (mean AUC drop <2%), suggesting that our predictions are not primarily driven by diagnostic procedures. For example, ASCVD AUC remains >0.89 with 1-year washout, compared to 0.89 with 0-year washout. This indicates that while ICD code dates may not be perfectly accurate, our model's predictive performance is robust to temporal uncertainty and does not rely heavily on diagnostic cascades.\"\n",
