        "1. **Model Learning**: How the model learns to distinguish high-risk from lower-risk patients\n",
        "2. **Washout Validity**: Whether washout periods correctly prevent temporal leakage (R2)\n",
        "3. **Signature Dynamics**: How patient-specific parameters (lambda) change as models are trained with more data\n",

        "All analyses use the `pooled_retrospective` approach by default, which:\n",

        "  - Real conditions (outcomes) → large changes\n",
        "  - Pre-clinical signals (precursors) → moderate changes\n",
