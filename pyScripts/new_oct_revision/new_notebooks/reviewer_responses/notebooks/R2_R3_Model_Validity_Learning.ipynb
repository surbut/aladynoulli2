        "1. **Model Learning**: How the model learns to distinguish high-risk from lower-risk patients\n",
        "2. **Washout Validity**: Whether washout periods correctly prevent temporal leakage (R2)\n",
        "3. **Signature Dynamics**: How patient-specific parameters (lambda) change as models are trained with more data\n",

        "All analyses use the `pooled_retrospective` approach by default, which:\n",

        "1. **Conservative washout (with outcome events):**\n",
        "   - Patients who had ASCVD events during washout\n",

        "   - Patients with precursors (e.g., hypercholesterolemia) but no ASCVD outcome during washout\n",
        "   - Signature 5 shows moderate positive lambda changes (+0.305)\n",
        "   - Model learns from pre-clinical signals (risk factors before outcomes)\n",

        "3. **Model refinement (without either):**\n",
        "   - Patients with neither precursor nor outcome\n",
        "   - Small negative lambda changes (-0.053)\n",
        "   - Model becomes more conservative/refined\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:**\n",
        "- The model distinguishes between:\n",
        "  - Real conditions (outcomes) → large changes\n",
        "  - Pre-clinical signals (precursors) → moderate changes\n",
        "  - Neither → small/negative changes\n",
        "- This validates washout accuracy: the model learns from legitimate risk factors, not just future outcomes\n",

        "**Conclusion:** This pattern supports model validity and washout accuracy. The model learns appropriately from pre-clinical signals, which is the intended behavior for accurate washout.\n"
