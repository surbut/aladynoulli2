        "# R3: Competing Risks - How Aladynoulli Addresses This Challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reviewer Question\n",
        "\n",
        "**Referee #3**: \"It's unclear to me whether and how well the model actually accounts for competing risks, such as death, emigration, and other strong competitors. This can also be caused by diagnostic hierarchy. What scares me are the reported hazards (e.g. figures S6-8), which seem to decrease for very old individuals, which can be interpreted as decreased risks. This looks like a competing risk issue.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional competing risk models assume that events are **mutually exclusive** - if you develop one disease, you're censored and can't develop others. However, in reality, patients often develop **multiple diseases over time**. Aladynoulli's multi-disease approach addresses this by modeling all diseases simultaneously, allowing patients to remain at risk for multiple conditions even after developing one.\n"

        "## How Aladynoulli Addresses Competing Risks\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Multi-Disease Modeling**: Unlike traditional competing risk models that censor patients after the first event, Aladynoulli models all 348 diseases simultaneously. Patients remain at risk for all diseases even after developing one.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **No Censoring After First Disease**: Traditional models would stop tracking a patient after MI. Aladynoulli continues to predict risk for cancer, heart failure, and other conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handling Death and Emigration**: \n",
        "   - Death is modeled as a competing event (disease outcome)\n",
        "   - Emigration is handled through censoring in the E matrix\n",
        "   - The model accounts for these through the survival framework\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Diagnostic Hierarchy**: The washout windows help address diagnostic hierarchy by ensuring predictions are made before disease onset, avoiding temporal leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Decreasing Hazards at Old Age**: This reflects real phenomena (administrative censoring, healthy survivor effect, competing risk of death) - see explanation below.\n"

        "✅ **Patients develop multiple diseases** - 59% of patients develop 2+ diseases from the 28 major categories\n",
        "✅ **Disease progression is sequential** - Patients often develop diseases in predictable patterns (e.g., Type 2 diabetes → ASCVD → Heart Failure)\n",
        "✅ **Aladynoulli predicts subsequent diseases** - Even after a patient develops one disease, the model can predict risk for others\n",
