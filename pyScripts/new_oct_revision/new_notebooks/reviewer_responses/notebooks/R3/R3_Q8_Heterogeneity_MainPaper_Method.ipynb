        "**Method:**\n",
        "1. **Cluster by time-averaged signature loadings** (k-means on mean theta across time)\n",
        "2. **Project deviations from reference** over time for each cluster\n",
        "3. **Correlate with PRS** to understand genetic differences between clusters\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Difference from Deviation-Based Method:**\n",
        "- **This method (main paper)**: Clusters patients based on their average signature levels, then visualizes how each cluster deviates from the population reference over time. More interpretable for clinical applications.\n",
        "- **Deviation-based method** (R3_Q8_Heterogeneity_Continued): Clusters patients based on how their trajectories deviate from the population average. Better for pathway discovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches demonstrate heterogeneity, but serve different purposes.\n"
