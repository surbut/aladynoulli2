    "STEP 0: ASSEMBLE FULL PI TENSORS\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "- Concatenates batch pi tensors (0-10000, 10000-20000, ..., 390000-400000) \n",
    "  into full pi tensors for 0-400K patients\n",
    "- Creates pi_enroll_fixedphi_sex_FULL.pt files needed by generation scripts\n",
    "- Run ONCE before running generation cells, then mark as \"not evaluated\"\n",
    "- Script: assemble_full_pi_tensor.py\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 1: GENERATE TIME HORIZON PREDICTIONS\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "- Generates predictions for multiple time horizons: 5yr, 10yr, 30yr, static 10yr\n",
    "- Processes ALL 400K patients at once using pre-computed pi tensors\n",
    "- Uses evaluate_major_diseases_wsex_with_bootstrap_dynamic_from_pi() for dynamic predictions\n",
    "- Uses evaluate_major_diseases_wsex_with_bootstrap_from_pi() for static predictions\n",
    "- Computes AUC on pooled predictions (statistically better than batch-averaging)\n",
    "- Approaches: pooled_enrollment and pooled_retrospective\n",
    "- Run ONCE, then mark as \"not evaluated\"\n",
    "- Script: generate_time_horizon_predictions.py\n",
    "- Results saved to: results/time_horizons/{approach}/\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 2: GENERATE WASHOUT PREDICTIONS\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "- Generates 1-year predictions with different washout periods: 0yr, 1yr, 2yr offsets\n",
    "- Processes ALL 400K patients at once using pre-computed pi tensors\n",
    "- Uses evaluate_major_diseases_wsex_with_bootstrap_dynamic_1year_different_start_end_numeric_sex()\n",
    "- Evaluates predictions made at enrollment_age + offset to predict events in subsequent year\n",
    "- Computes AUC on pooled predictions\n",
    "- Approaches: pooled_enrollment and pooled_retrospective\n",
    "- Run ONCE, then mark as \"not evaluated\"\n",
    "- Script: generate_washout_predictions.py\n",
    "- Results saved to: results/washout/{approach}/\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 3: GENERATE AGE OFFSET PREDICTIONS\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "- Generates rolling 1-year predictions using models trained at different time offsets\n",
    "- Evaluates models trained at enrollment + 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 years (offsets 0-9)\n",
    "- Uses pre-computed pi batches from AWS run (downloaded to ~/Downloads/age_offset_files/)\n",
    "- Currently evaluates on batch 0-10000 (first 10K patients)\n",
    "- Shows how model performance changes when predictions are made at different time points\n",
    "  after enrollment, using models retrained with additional follow-up data\n",
    "- Approaches: pooled_enrollment and pooled_retrospective\n",
    "- Run ONCE, then mark as \"not evaluated\"\n",
    "- Script: generate_age_offset_predictions.py\n",
    "- Results saved to: results/age_offset/{approach}/\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 4: LOAD GENERATED RESULTS\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "- Loads all generated CSV files into dictionaries for analysis\n",
    "- Safe to run multiple times (reloads results without regenerating)\n",
    "- Loads: time_horizon_results, washout_results, age_offset_results\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 5: COMPARE WITH EXTERNAL SCORES\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "- Compares Aladynoulli predictions with external risk scores on same 400K population\n",
    "- External scores: PCE (10-year ASCVD), PREVENT (30-year ASCVD), \n",
    "                   Gail (10-year Breast Cancer), QRISK3 (10-year ASCVD)\n",
    "- Uses unified file: ukb_pce_prevent_gail_qrisk3_combined.csv\n",
    "- Main comparison uses pooled_retrospective approach (clinically implementable)\n",
    "- Run ONCE, then mark as \"not evaluated\"\n",
    "- Script: compare_with_external_scores.py\n",
    "- Results saved to: results/comparisons/{approach}/external_scores_comparison.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "MAIN APPROACH: Pooled Retrospective\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "All comparisons use the pooled_retrospective approach by default, which:\n",
    "- Uses phi trained externally and validated with LOO tests\n",
    "- Represents clinically implementable performance\n",
    "- Uses pi from: enrollment_predictions_fixedphi_RETROSPECTIVE_pooled/pi_enroll_fixedphi_sex_FULL.pt\n",
