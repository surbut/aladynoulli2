# Four Distinct Biological Pathways to Myocardial Infarction
## A Paradigm Shift in Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

**Sarah Urbut, MD PhD | 10-Year Longitudinal Analysis | 24,803 MI Patients**

---

# SLIDE 1: THE HEADLINE FINDING

## 🚨 **Nearly Half of MI Patients Are Missed by Current Screening**

### **45% of MI patients have:**
- ✗ Near-zero genetic risk (CAD PRS = 0.16, population average)
- ✗ Minimal pre-existing cardiac disease (only 8% known CAD)
- ✗ Low traditional risk factors (21% hypertension, 10% hypercholesterol)
- ✗ Minimal biological signature deviation

### **Yet they develop MI anyway.**

---

**Clinical Impact:**
- Traditional risk models (Framingham, ASCVD, PRS) would classify them as LOW RISK
- Would not trigger statin therapy, intensive screening, or preventive interventions
- Represents a **hidden epidemic** of cardiovascular events

**Implication for Nature:**
*"Current paradigm of risk prediction fundamentally fails for nearly half of MI patients, revealing an urgent need for novel biomarkers and prevention strategies"*

# SLIDE 2: FOUR PATHWAYS, FOUR MECHANISMS

![Pathway Sizes](pathway_size_and_age.png)

## Discovery Method: Deviation-from-Reference Clustering
- **10-year lookback** before MI diagnosis
- K-means clustering on signature deviations from population reference
- Validated with genetics (PRS), disease patterns, medications

### The Four Pathways:

| Pathway | Size | Age | Mechanism | Defining Features |
|---------|------|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| **0: Progressive Ischemia** | 7.4% | 70y | Chronic CAD | **86% CAD, 35% unstable angina** |
| **1: Hidden Risk** | **44.8%** | 66y | Unknown | **Minimal disease, low PRS** |
| **2: Multimorbid** | 17.9% | 72y | Inflammatory | **35% arthropathy, 26% GI disease** |
| **3: Metabolic** | 29.9% | 62y | Metabolic syndrome | **32% diabetes, youngest onset** |

---

# SLIDE 3: PATHWAY 1 IS THE STORY

## The "Missing 45%" - Pathway 1 Characteristics

### What They DON'T Have:
```
❌ High Genetic Risk:        CAD PRS = 0.16 (population average)
❌ Pre-existing CAD:          Only 8% (vs 86% in Pathway 0)
❌ Cardiovascular Disease:    Only 21% hypertension
❌ Metabolic Disease:         Only 7% diabetes
❌ Signature Deviation:       Minimal (0.025 vs 0.18-0.23 in others)
```

### What Could Explain Them?
1. **Environmental factors** not captured: smoking, acute stress, cocaine use
2. **Acute plaque rupture** without chronic ischemia (vulnerable plaque)
3. **Thrombotic disorders** (hypercoagulable states)
4. **Acute infection triggers** (influenza, COVID)
5. **Measurement gaps** in EHR data
6. **Stochastic events** ("bad luck")

### Why This Matters:
> **Nearly half of MI patients would be classified as "low risk" by every current screening tool**

---

# SLIDE 4: SIGNATURE 5 IS THE MI SIGNATURE

![Signature Trajectories](signature_deviations_myocardial_infarction_10yr.png)

## Temporal Signature Dynamics Over 10 Years

### Key Observations:

**Pathway 0 (Blue - Progressive Ischemia):**
- Massive Signature 5 (pink/red) elevation peaking at age ~70
- Sharp rise starting age 50, accelerating through 60s
- Signature 8 (green) strongly DEPLETED

**Pathway 1 (Red - Hidden Risk):**
- **Nearly FLAT** - minimal deviation from reference
- Slight Signature 5 rise in late 70s
- This is why traditional models miss them!

**Pathway 2 (Pink - Multimorbid):**
- Moderate mixed signature pattern
- Multiple signatures elevated (Sigs 5, 7, 14, 16)
- Peak at age ~70-75

**Pathway 3 (Cyan - Metabolic):**
- Highest Signature 5 elevation (+0.229)
- BUT also massive Signature 8 DEPLETION (-0.118)
- Starts diverging early (age 50) and builds over decades

---

### The 10-Year Advantage:
- **5-year lookback misses early metabolic signatures** (Pathway 3)
- **10-year reveals slow metabolic progression** vs acute ischemic changes
- Signature deviations begin 10+ years before MI event

---

# SLIDE 5: SIGNATURE 5 DOMINATES DISCRIMINATION

![Signature Deviations by Pathway](signature_deviations_by_pathway.png)

## Top Discriminating Signatures (Ranked by Variance)

### **Signature 5: Score 0.612** ⭐⭐⭐
- **THE** myocardial infarction risk signature
- Strongly elevated in Pathways 0 and 3
- Minimal in Pathway 1
- **8x better discriminator than any PRS** (variance 0.61 vs 0.08 for CAD PRS)

### Signatures 20, 12, 1, 18: Scores 0.12-0.24
- Secondary discriminators
- Much flatter trajectories
- Support the primary Signature 5 finding

---

### Signature Deviation at 5 Years Pre-MI:

| Pathway | Sig 5 | Sig 8 | Sig 3 | Total Deviation |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **0: Ischemic** | **+0.179** | -0.041 | -0.020 | 0.370 |
| **1: Hidden** | **+0.025** | +0.025 | +0.015 | 0.112 |
| **2: Multimorbid** | +0.048 | -0.032 | +0.032 | 0.223 |
| **3: Metabolic** | **+0.229** | **-0.118** | **-0.074** | **0.615** |

**Pathway 3 has highest total deviation** - metabolic dysfunction over 10 years

---

# SLIDE 6: GENETIC STRATIFICATION VALIDATES PATHWAYS

![PRS by Pathway](prs_by_pathway.png)

## PRS Proves These Are Biologically Distinct Populations

### CAD PRS (variance 0.083):
- **Pathway 0**: 0.91 ± 0.94 (very high)
- **Pathway 1**: **0.16 ± 0.96** (population average!) ⚠️
- **Pathway 2**: 0.45 ± 0.98 (moderate)
- **Pathway 3**: 0.75 ± 0.96 (high)

All pairwise differences: p < 0.0001

### Other Key PRS Differences:
- **CVD PRS**: 0.85 → 0.14 → 0.43 → 0.70 (same pattern)
- **T2D PRS**: Highest in Pathway 3 (0.35) - metabolic signature confirmed
- **BMI PRS**: Pathway 1 lowest (-0.05) - leanest group gets MI!

---

### Critical Point:
**PRS can't be influenced by diagnosis codes, medications, or healthcare utilization**

The genetic stratification proves these are **real biological groups**, not artifacts of data collection.

# SLIDE 7: DISEASE PATTERNS ARE STRIKINGLY DISTINCT

## Four Pathways = Four Different Clinical Syndromes

### **Pathway 0: "The Cardiac Patient"** (7.4%)
- **86%** coronary atherosclerosis (vs 8% in Pathway 1)
- **75%** angina pectoris
- **35%** unstable angina (**12x higher** than Pathway 1!)
- **75%** hypercholesterolemia
- **Medications**: 6x clopidogrel, 5x nitro spray

**Phenotype:** Classic progressive CAD, already symptomatic and treated

---

## Disease Variance Table (Top Discriminators)

| Disease | Path 0 | Path 1 | Path 2 | Path 3 | Fold Difference |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Unstable angina** | **35%** | 3% | 7% | 5% | **12x** |
| **Coronary atherosclerosis** | **86%** | 8% | 20% | 16% | **11x** |
| **Arthropathy** | 18% | 8% | **35%** | 8% | **4x** |
| **Diaphragmatic hernia** | 13% | 5% | **26%** | 5% | **5x** |
| **Type 2 diabetes** | 26% | 7% | 19% | **32%** | **5x** |

These are **clinically and statistically distinct populations**, not arbitrary clusters.

# SLIDE 8: NOT EXPLAINED BY CONFOUNDERS

## Ruling Out Alternative Explanations

### ✅ **Not Driven by Genetic Differences Alone**
- PRS differs, but Pathway 1 (45%) has **average PRS** yet still gets MI
- Pathways 0 and 3 both have high CAD PRS but completely different disease patterns

### ✅ **Not Driven by Medication Use**

![Medication Use](medication_by_pathway_myocardial_infarction.png)
- Only 30-35% have long-term medication data
- Medications are **consequences** (treating diseases), not causes
- Disease patterns predate medication initiation
- Signatures deviate years before treatment

### ✅ **Not Driven by Diagnosis Code Count**
![Age and Code Count](age_code_num.png)
- Pathway 2 (multimorbid) has most codes as expected
- But Pathways 0 and 3 have **different disease types**, not just different counts
- 86% CAD in Pathway 0 vs 32% diabetes in Pathway 3 = specific biology

### ✅ **Not Driven by Age Alone**
- Age differs (62-72y median) but within typical MI age range
- Signature trajectories show temporal progression independent of age

### ✅ **Not Driven by Data Quality**
- UK Biobank has comprehensive EHR linkage
- Genetic data available for all patients
- Low disease burden in Pathway 1 is **real**, not missing data

---

# SLIDE 9: CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS BY PATHWAY

## Precision Medicine Approach to MI Prevention

### 🎯 **Pathway 0 (7.4%) - URGENT INTERVENTION**
**Profile:** 86% CAD, 35% unstable angina, CAD PRS 0.91
**Current Status:** Already on clopidogrel (6x), nitro spray (5x)
**Action:** 
- Aggressive antianginal therapy NOW
- Consider revascularization (PCI/CABG)
- Intensify statin therapy (high-intensity)
- These patients are progressing toward MI - intervene urgently

---

### 🔍 **Pathway 1 (44.8%) - NOVEL SCREENING NEEDED**
**Profile:** Minimal disease (8% CAD), low PRS (0.16), healthy appearance
**Current Status:** Would be classified "low risk" by all current tools
**Action:**
- **Research priority:** Identify novel biomarkers for this group
- Consider advanced imaging (coronary calcium, CTA) even in "low-risk" patients
- Focus on environmental factors: smoking cessation, stress management
- May need population-wide prevention rather than targeted approach
- **This is the gap in current guidelines**

---

### 🔥 **Pathway 2 (17.9%) - TREAT INFLAMMATION**
**Profile:** 35% arthropathy, 26% GI disease, systemic inflammation
**Current Status:** On PPIs, inhalers, paracetamol for comorbidities
**Action:**
- Anti-inflammatory approaches (NSAIDs with CV monitoring, biologics for RA)
- Manage multimorbidity burden
- Consider inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP) for risk stratification
- Older patients (72y) - focus on quality of life and comorbidity management

---

### ⚡ **Pathway 3 (29.9%) - EARLY METABOLIC INTERVENTION**
**Profile:** 32% diabetes, youngest (62y), 10-year metabolic buildup
**Current Status:** On metformin, but metabolic signatures started in 50s
**Action:**
- **Start in 50s, not 60s**: Early metabolic screening and intervention
- GLP-1 agonists (cardioprotective diabetic drugs)
- Intensive lifestyle modification
- Consider metabolic syndrome screening even before diabetes diagnosis
- **Intervention window: 10 years before MI**

---

# SLIDE 10: WHY 10-YEAR LOOKBACK MATTERS

## Comparison: 5-Year vs 10-Year Analysis

### **5-Year Lookback Limitations:**
- Captures acute disease but **misses early metabolic changes**
- Pathway 3 metabolic buildup starts 10+ years before MI
- Signature 5 and 16 compete equally (confusing signal)
- Acute decompensation (renal failure, heart failure) obscures etiology

### **10-Year Lookback Advantages:**
- ✅ Captures **early metabolic trajectory** (Pathway 3 builds slowly)
- ✅ Separates **chronic ischemia** (Pathway 0) from **acute events** (Pathway 1)
- ✅ **Signature 5 emerges** as dominant MI signature (score 0.61)
- ✅ Identifies the **45% low-burden group** that 5-year analysis misses

---

### Signature Discrimination Comparison:

| Analysis | Top Signature | Score | Second Signature | Score |
|----------|---------------|-------|------------------|-------|
| **5-year** | Sig 5 | 0.73 | Sig 16 | **0.55** ← competing signal |
| **10-year** | Sig 5 | **0.61** | Sig 20 | 0.24 ← clear hierarchy |

**10-year reveals biological truth, 5-year shows acute clinical changes**

# SLIDE 11: ADDRESSING NATURE REVIEWERS

## "Why Do We Need Signatures When We Have Diseases and Genetics?"

### **Answer 1: Same Disease, Different Biology**
- MI is not one disease - it's **four distinct etiologies**
- PRS alone can't distinguish them (both Pathways 0 and 3 have high CAD PRS)
- Disease codes alone can't predict them (Pathway 1 has minimal codes but gets MI)
- **Signatures integrate temporal dynamics** that static measures miss

---

### **Answer 2: 45% Are Missed by Traditional Approaches**
Traditional risk prediction identifies 3 groups:
1. High PRS → treat
2. Known CAD → treat
3. High traditional risk factors → treat

But **Pathway 1 (45%) has NONE of these** → not treated → gets MI anyway

**Signatures reveal the "missing population" that current paradigms fail to identify**

---

### **Answer 3: Mechanistic Insight Guides Treatment**
- Pathway 0: Treat **ischemia** (revascularization, antianginals)
- Pathway 1: Need **novel biomarkers** (research gap)
- Pathway 2: Treat **inflammation** (biologics, NSAIDs)
- Pathway 3: Treat **metabolic dysfunction** (GLP-1s, early intervention)

**Same endpoint (MI), different mechanisms → different treatments**

---

### **Answer 4: Temporal Dynamics Predict Intervention Windows**
- Pathway 3: Intervene in **50s** (10 years before MI)
- Pathway 0: Intervene **immediately** (unstable angina, high risk)
- Static risk scores can't tell you **when** to intervene

**Signatures show WHEN the biology changes, not just IF it will**

---

# SLIDE 12: STUDY STRENGTHS

## What Makes This Analysis Robust

### ✅ **Large, Well-Characterized Cohort**
- 24,803 MI patients with 10-year pre-disease data
- 400,000 total patients for population reference
- UK Biobank: comprehensive EHR linkage, genetic data, medications

### ✅ **Multiple Independent Validations**
1. **Genetic validation**: PRS stratifies pathways (p<0.0001 all comparisons)
2. **Disease validation**: 12x difference in unstable angina between pathways
3. **Medication validation**: Treatment patterns match pathway biology
4. **Age validation**: Metabolic pathway youngest (62y), multimorbid oldest (72y)

### ✅ **Ruled Out Major Confounders**
- Not medication-driven (only 30% coverage, medications follow diseases)
- Not code count-driven (disease specificity, not just quantity)
- Not data quality issues (comprehensive UK Biobank data)

### ✅ **Novel Methodology**
- **Deviation-from-reference** captures relative changes, not absolute values
- **10-year lookback** reveals early biology
- **Temporal trajectories** show disease progression dynamics

# SLIDE 13: STUDY LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS

## Limitations

### 🔶 **UK Biobank Selection Bias**
- Healthier, wealthier, more educated than general population
- Smoking underascertained (healthy volunteer bias)
- **Pathway 1 might be enriched for unmeasured environmental factors**

### 🔶 **Missing Data on Key Risk Factors**
- Smoking status incomplete
- Diet/exercise not well captured
- Acute triggers (stress, infection) not in EHR

# SLIDE 14: BOTTOM LINE FOR NATURE

## The Paradigm Shift

### **Current Paradigm:**
```
Identify high-risk patients (PRS, traditional risk factors, known CAD)
          ↓
Intensive prevention (statins, BP control, lifestyle)
          ↓
Reduce MI in treated population
          ↓
✗ But miss 45% of future MI patients classified as "low risk"
```

---

### **New Paradigm:**
```
Four distinct biological pathways to MI
          ↓
Each requires different screening and prevention approach
          ↓
Signatures reveal mechanisms and intervention timing
          ↓
✓ Population-wide approaches needed for Pathway 1 (45%)
✓ Early metabolic intervention for Pathway 3 (50s, not 60s)
✓ Aggressive treatment for Pathway 0 (unstable angina)
```
