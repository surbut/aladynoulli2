\section{Introduction}
Predicting the onset of complex diseases remains one of medicine's grand challenges. While electronic health records (EHRs) now capture rich longitudinal data on millions of patients, our ability to translate these data into accurate, personalized disease forecasts remains limited. Current approaches typically focus on predicting single diseases using static risk factors, failing to capture the dynamic, interconnected nature of disease development [1,2].

The human disease trajectory—the temporal sequence of health states a person experiences—emerges from complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and physiological processes [3]. These underlying processes often manifest across multiple related conditions before culminating in clinical diagnoses. For example, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) develops through decades of subclinical progression, with risk factors and early manifestations appearing years before major events like myocardial infarction [4].

We hypothesized that latent disease signatures—unobserved biological processes that influence multiple disease risks simultaneously—could be inferred from longitudinal health records and used to predict future disease trajectories. These signatures would represent fundamental patterns of disease susceptibility that evolve over time and manifest differently across individuals.

Here, we present a probabilistic model that identifies interpretable disease signatures and captures their patient-specific temporal evolution. Our approach, which we call Aladynoulli (Adaptive LAtent DYNamics), learns a set of latent signatures that associate with different disease patterns, while simultaneously modeling how each patient's relationship to these signatures changes over time. Unlike traditional risk models that rely on known clinical risk factors, Aladynoulli discovers latent patterns directly from disease co-occurrence data, potentially capturing biological processes not yet recognized in clinical practice.

We applied Aladynoulli to longitudinal health records from [dataset description], comprising [N] patients followed for up to [T] years across [D] disease categories. To rigorously evaluate predictive performance, we implemented a censoring approach that simulates real-world prediction scenarios by hiding future ASCVD events during model training. Our model successfully predicted these censored events, demonstrating its ability to identify at-risk patients years before clinical diagnosis.
Beyond prediction, Aladynoulli reveals distinct patient subgroups with shared disease signature patterns, potentially representing different pathophysiological mechanisms. By connecting these signatures to genetic data, we identified both known and novel genetic associations, providing insights into the biological processes underlying disease trajectories.
Our findings demonstrate that modeling latent disease signatures and their temporal dynamics can improve disease prediction while offering new perspectives on disease mechanisms. This approach represents a step toward precision medicine that accounts for the complex, time-varying nature of disease risk.

\section{Model Overview}

ALADYNOULLI (Adaptive LAtent DYNamics with BernOULLI outcomes) captures the complex interplay between latent disease signatures and their temporal evolution in individual patients (Fig. 1A). The model represents disease risk through a mixture of latent signatures that evolve over time.

For each patient $i$, disease $d$, and time point $t$, we model the probability of disease occurrence $\pi_{i,d,t}$ as:

$$\pi_{i,d,t} = \kappa \cdot \sum_{k} \theta_{i,k,t} \cdot \text{expit}(\phi_{k,d,t})$$

where $\kappa$ is a calibration parameter, $\theta_{i,k,t}$ represents patient $i$'s time-varying association with signature $k$, and $\phi_{k,d,t}$ captures the relationship between signature $k$ and disease $d$ over time.

The patient-signature associations are modeled as a softmax over latent variables:

$$\theta_{i,k,t} = \text{softmax}_k(\lambda_{i,\cdot,t})$$

This ensures that signature associations form a proper mixture, with patients exhibiting varying degrees of affinity for different signatures over time.

The patient-specific latent variables follow a Gaussian process prior:

$$\lambda_{i,k} \sim \mathcal{N}(r_k \cdot \mathbf{1}_T + \Gamma_k^{\top}\mathbf{g}_i \cdot \mathbf{1}_T, K_{\lambda})$$

where $r_k$ is a signature-specific baseline, $\Gamma_k$ captures how genetic/demographic factors $\mathbf{g}_i$ influence signature affinity, and $K_{\lambda}$ is a kernel function ensuring temporal smoothness.

Similarly, the disease-signature associations follow a Gaussian process:

$$\phi_{k,d} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_d + \psi_{k,d} \cdot \mathbf{1}_T, K_{\phi})$$

where $\mu_d$ is a disease-specific baseline, $\psi_{k,d}$ represents the overall strength of association between signature $k$ and disease $d$, and $K_{\phi}$ allows for temporal variation in these associations.

The distribution of $\theta$ values across the population reveals distinct patient subgroups with varying signature affinities (Fig. 1B). For example, a subset of patients shows increasing values of $\theta_{i,5,t}$ over time, indicating growing association with Signature 5, which is strongly linked to cardiovascular diseases.

The learned $\psi_{k,d}$ parameters reveal distinct disease association patterns for each signature (Fig. 1C). For example, Signature 5 shows strong positive associations with multiple cardiovascular conditions including myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure, suggesting it may represent an underlying atherosclerotic process.

By modeling both patient-signature associations ($\theta$) and signature-disease associations ($\phi$), ALADYNOULLI captures the dynamic nature of disease risk while learning interpretable patterns. This structure enables three key capabilities: (1) predicting future disease occurrences by projecting signature trajectories forward in time, (2) identifying patient subgroups with similar signature patterns, and (3) adapting predictions as new clinical information becomes available (Fig. 1D).

This formulation allows ALADYNOULLI to discover latent patterns directly from disease co-occurrence data, potentially capturing biological processes not yet recognized in clinical practice. The Bernoulli likelihood component properly models the binary nature of disease events while accounting for their temporal dependencies through the latent signature dynamics.

Citing references:
Science uses a numeric citation system. Cite references by number e.g.~\cite{example}.
The template will combine reference numbers automatically~\cite{example,example2},
including ranges~\cite{example,example2, example_preprint}.
Reference author names and years should be stated in the reference list, not in the text.
If you want to add a comment, use the syntax [see \cite{example} for details].
% Not \cite[see][for details]{example}. Unfortunately that isn't compatible with scicite.sty

Referring to supplementary material:
Whenever more details are given in the Materials and Methods section, cite an entry in
the reference list that directs readers there, like this~\cite{methods}.
To refer to material in the Supplementary Text section, just write (Supplementary Text).
See guidance below for the difference between those two types of supplementary material.
Supplementary figures and tables are referred to in lowercase
e.g.~figure~\ref{fig:sup_example} or table~\ref{tab:sup_example}.
Material in separate files needs to be hand coded e.g.~data~S1, movie~S2.

Mathematics:
Simple mathematical expressions can be inserted in the text like $2\times3=6$.
Variables should be italic but textual labels are roman e.g.~$T_\text{max}$.
Explain the meaning of all variables on their first appearance.
More complicated expressions should be entered as numbered equations, such as

\begin{equation}
	x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:example} % Use a logical label
\end{equation}

\noindent\ Do not indent text immediately after an equation.
They can be referred back to as e.g.~Equation~\ref{eq:example}.

Formatting:
Names of software packages should be set in small capitals e.g.~\textsc{NumPy}.
Use a non-breaking space between a number and its unit e.g.~7.4~km,
and thin spaces between different parts of a unit e.g.~12~m\,s$^{-1}$.
Use $\pm$ (not parentheses) to indicate uncertainties e.g.~$g=9.8\pm0.2$~m\,s$^{-2}$.

% Research Articles and Reviews split the text into sections using headings
% Use a short (up 6 words) descriptive phrase, not generic 'Results' or 'Conclusions'
% Most other formats do not have headings, see the journal instructions to authors for details
\subsection*{An example heading}
Research Articles and Reviews use headings to split the main text into sections;
most other formats do not have headings.

Length limits:
The \textit{Science}-family journals impose limits on the number of words, figures\slash
tables, and references cited in the main text.
The limits vary between the journals and article types.
Refer to the instructions to authors on the journal website for the current limits.
