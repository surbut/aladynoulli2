    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why Signatures vs. Diseases?**: Just as Phecodes aggregate 1,133 ICD-10 codes into 53 categories (21.4× reduction), signatures aggregate 348 diseases into 21 biological pathways (16.6× reduction). This aggregation reveals higher-level patterns that individual codes/diseases miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Patient Heterogeneity**: Different individuals with same diagnosis show different signature profiles (average distance = 3.87)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Biological Heterogeneity**: Same phenotype (MI) arises from 4 distinct pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Disease Heterogeneity**: Clinical diagnoses are not single entities—our model captures this through individual-specific signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response to Reviewer\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"We clarify our use of 'heterogeneity' as follows: (1) **Patient Heterogeneity**: Different individuals with the same disease diagnosis have different signature profiles (measured by average pairwise distance in signature space = 3.87). For example, two patients with CAD may have different metabolic vs. inflammatory signatures. (2) **Biological Heterogeneity**: Same clinical phenotype can arise from different biological pathways. For example, CAD can be driven by metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, or genetic factors. We demonstrate this through pathway analysis identifying 4 distinct pathways to myocardial infarction (progressive ischemia, hidden risk, inflammatory, metabolic). (3) **Disease Heterogeneity**: Umbrella term encompassing both patient and biological heterogeneity—the observation that 'CAD' is not a single entity but a collection of related conditions. Our model captures this through individual-specific signature loadings. We now consistently use these terms throughout the manuscript and define them in Methods.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Why use signatures instead of diseases?** The same aggregation principle that makes Phecodes more informative than individual ICD-10 codes applies to signatures versus diseases. Just as Phecodes aggregate 1,133 ICD-10 codes into 53 clinically meaningful categories (21.4× reduction), signatures aggregate 348 diseases into 21 biologically meaningful pathways (16.6× reduction). This reveals shared biological mechanisms across diseases that individual disease codes cannot capture.\"\n",
