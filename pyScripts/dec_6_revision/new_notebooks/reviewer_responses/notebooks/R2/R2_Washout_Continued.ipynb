    "# Washout Analysis: Fixed Prediction Timepoint\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs washout analysis by comparing models trained with different amounts of historical data, evaluated at the **same prediction timepoint** with the **same outcome window**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the same model at different timepoints, we:\n",
    "- Use **different models** (trained at different offsets = different amounts of data seen)\n",
    "- Evaluate at the **same prediction timepoint** (e.g., enrollment+1 year)\n",
    "- Use the **same outcome window** (e.g., 1 year or 10 years forward)\n",
    "\n",
    "This directly tests the impact of recent information (washout effect):\n",
    "- **1-year washout**: Use offset 0 model (trained only up to enrollment) → predicts at enrollment+1\n",
    "- **0-year washout**: Use offset 1 model (trained up to enrollment+1) → predicts at enrollment+1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are from `/Users/sarahurbut/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personall/age_offset_local_vectorized_E_corrected/`:\n",
    "- `pi_enroll_fixedphi_age_offset_0_sex_*_*.pt` - Trained with data up to enrollment\n",
    "- `pi_enroll_fixedphi_age_offset_1_sex_*_*.pt` - Trained with data up to enrollment+1\n",
    "- `pi_enroll_fixedphi_age_offset_2_sex_*_*.pt` - Trained with data up to enrollment+2\n",
    "\n",
    "These models were generated using `claudefile/aws_offsetmaster/forAWS_offsetmaster_vectorized_checkpointcenosrE.py`.\n"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

    "## Summary for Reviewers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis addresses reviewer concerns about temporal leakage by systematically evaluating Aladynoulli's performance when blinded to recent diagnostic information. We implement a rigorous \"washout\" analysis that preserves prediction timepoints and outcome intervals while varying only the amount of historical data available to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Principle**: Our washout analysis maintains **identical prediction timepoints** and **identical outcome windows** across all comparisons, while systematically varying the amount of historical data the model can access. This directly tests robustness to temporal leakage while ensuring fair comparison conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Implementation**:\n",
    "- **Prediction Timepoint**: Fixed (e.g., enrollment+1 year)\n",
    "- **Outcome Window**: Fixed (e.g., 1 year forward from prediction timepoint)\n",
    "- **Model Training Data**: Varied (models trained with data up to prediction timepoint minus washout period)\n",
    "  - **0-year washout**: Model sees data up to prediction timepoint\n",
    "  - **1-year washout**: Model sees data only up to 1 year before prediction timepoint\n",
    "  - **2-year washout**: Model sees data only up to 2 years before prediction timepoint\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Delphi**: We compare Aladynoulli's washout performance (1-year and 2-year washouts) with Delphi's 1-year gap performance, where both models are evaluated under similar conditions of reduced recent information access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robust Performance with Washout**: Aladynoulli maintains competitive performance even when blinded to 1-2 years of recent diagnostic information. Across 27 diseases evaluated, Aladynoulli outperforms Delphi in 55.6% of cases (15/27 diseases) with 1-year washout.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exceptional Cancer and ASCVD Performance**: Aladynoulli demonstrates particularly strong performance for cancer predictions and ASCVD with washout:\n",
    "   - **Breast Cancer**: Aladynoulli 0.679 vs Delphi 0.530 (+0.149 advantage, +28.2% relative improvement)\n",
    "   - **Lung Cancer**: Aladynoulli 0.799 vs Delphi 0.672 (+0.127 advantage, +18.9% relative improvement)\n",
    "   - **Prostate Cancer**: Aladynoulli 0.737 vs Delphi 0.619 (+0.118 advantage, +19.1% relative improvement)\n",
    "   - **Colorectal Cancer**: Aladynoulli 0.694 vs Delphi 0.587 (+0.107 advantage, +18.2% relative improvement)\n",
    "   - **ASCVD**: Aladynoulli 0.742 vs Delphi 0.661 (+0.081 advantage, +12.3% relative improvement)\n",
    "   - **All Cancers**: Aladynoulli 0.691 vs Delphi 0.551 (+0.139 advantage, +25.2% relative improvement)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reduced Performance Degradation**: When comparing performance drops from 0-gap (full data) to 1-year washout/gap, Aladynoulli shows less degradation than Delphi for most diseases, indicating superior robustness to information loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comprehensive Washout Analysis**: We systematically evaluated all combinations of 1-year and 2-year washouts across prediction timepoints from enrollment+1 to enrollment+9, demonstrating consistent patterns of robust performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The exceptional performance of Aladynoulli with washout, particularly for cancers and ASCVD, demonstrates that the model captures **fundamental biological signatures** that precede clinical diagnosis by years. This suggests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long-term Disease Patterns**: Aladynoulli leverages disease trajectories and biological processes that develop over extended time periods, not just recent diagnostic events\n",
    "- **Reduced Temporal Leakage**: The model's performance is not primarily driven by recent diagnostic cascades or temporally inaccurate ICD codes\n",
    "- **Biological Plausibility**: The ability to predict diseases years in advance, even when blinded to recent information, aligns with the known long-term development of conditions like cancer and cardiovascular disease\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The robustness to washout has important clinical implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Detection Potential**: The model's ability to maintain performance with washout suggests it can identify at-risk individuals well before clinical symptoms or diagnostic events\n",
    "2. **Preventive Care**: By capturing long-term biological patterns, Aladynoulli may enable earlier intervention opportunities\n",
    "3. **Reliable Risk Assessment**: The reduced dependence on recent diagnostic information makes the model more robust to variations in healthcare access and diagnostic timing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This washout analysis directly addresses reviewer concerns about temporal leakage by demonstrating that Aladynoulli maintains competitive and often superior performance even when systematically blinded to recent diagnostic information. The exceptional performance for cancers and ASCVD, combined with reduced performance degradation compared to Delphi, provides strong evidence that Aladynoulli captures fundamental biological disease signatures rather than relying on temporally problematic diagnostic patterns.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Washout Effect**: How much performance degrades when the model is blinded to recent information\n",
    "2. **Robustness**: Diseases where performance is maintained even with 1-2 year washout\n",
    "3. **Temporal Leakage**: Diseases where recent information is critical (large AUC drop with washout)\n",
    "4. **Exceptional Cancer Performance**: Aladynoulli demonstrates particularly strong performance for cancer predictions even with 1-2 year washout, maintaining substantial advantages over Delphi\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison uses:\n",
    "- **Same prediction timepoint** (e.g., enrollment+1)\n",
    "- **Same outcome window** (e.g., 1 year forward)\n",
    "- **Different models** (trained with different amounts of historical data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight for Cancers**: Aladynoulli's exceptional performance on cancer predictions with washout demonstrates the model's ability to leverage long-term disease patterns that are not dependent on recent diagnostic information. This suggests Aladynoulli captures fundamental biological signatures that precede clinical diagnosis by years, making it particularly robust to temporal leakage concerns.\n",
