    "# R3: Competing Risks - Patients Can Develop Multiple Diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewer Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Referee #3**: \"It's unclear to me whether and how well the model actually accounts for competing risks, such as death, emigration, and other strong competitors. This can also be caused by diagnostic hierarchy. What scares me are the reported hazards (e.g. figures S6-8), which seem to decrease for very old individuals, which can be interpreted as decreased risks. This looks like a competing risk issue.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Response\n",
    "\n",
    "The reviewer's primary concern about decreasing hazards at older ages is addressed in **R3_Q4_Decreasing_Hazards_Censoring_Bias.ipynb** (this was censoring bias, not competing risks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding competing risks: Traditional competing risk models assume events are **mutually exclusive** - if you develop one disease, you're censored and can't develop others. However, in reality, patients often develop **multiple serious diseases over time**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Aladynoulli's multi-disease approach naturally handles this** by modeling all 348 diseases simultaneously. Patients remain at risk for all diseases even after developing one. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates this by finding patients who develop multiple serious outcomes (e.g., Myocardial Infarction, Lung Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Breast Cancer) and showing that their predicted risks are elevated over the corrected population prevalence baseline for all diseases.\n"

    "## Key Point: Multiple Diseases Are Not Mutually Exclusive\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional competing risk models, Aladynoulli:\n",
    "- **Models all 348 diseases simultaneously** - patients can develop multiple diseases\n",
    "- **No censoring after first disease** - patients remain at risk for all diseases\n",
    "- **Handles real-world complexity** - patients often develop multiple serious conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples below show patients who develop multiple serious outcomes (MI, Lung Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Breast Cancer) and demonstrate that their predicted risks are elevated over the corrected population prevalence baseline for all diseases.\n"
