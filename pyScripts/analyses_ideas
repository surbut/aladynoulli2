Overview of Methods (1-2 pages) 
• What is the model extracting 
• Simulation results: strong calibration 
• Some details about inference
Overview of application to real data 
• UKB + MGB +/- AOU 
Pop level Parameters are stable / ind-level params are flexible 
Examples: CAD, peaks
Continuous updates / converge when distance occurs
Prediction 
 PCE/Prevent comparison (CAD) xage
Breast cancer, AF
Heterogeneity
Cases of CAD/ Depression/LCa cluster based on other sig values
 Velocity
Ata a population level, over age
Identify high/low
Pairwise (e.g., one goes up, the other down)
GWAS 
On AUC, velocity
