# Common Variant Associations (GWAS) {#gwas}

## Signature-Based GWAS

Traditional GWAS tests association between genetic variants and binary disease outcomes. ALADYNOULLI enables a different approach: GWAS on **continuous signature values**.

For each individual, we compute their signature exposure:

$$\text{Exposure}_k = \sum_{t} \theta_{ikt}$$

This cumulative signature exposure captures lifetime disease burden in that signature. We then test:

$$\text{Exposure}_k \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{SNP} + \text{covariates}$$

## Results: 151 Genome-Wide Significant Loci

Across 21 signatures, we identify **151 genome-wide significant loci** (p < 5×10⁻⁸):

| Signature | Loci | Top Genes |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| SIG5 (Cardiovascular) | 42 | LPA, APOB, LDLR, IL6R, PCSK9 |
| SIG7 (Metabolic) | 28 | FTO, MC4R, TMEM18, TCF7L2 |
| SIG11 (Cancer) | 23 | TERT, ATM, TP53, BRCA2 |
| SIG6 (Psychiatric) | 18 | CACNA1C, DRD2, BDNF |
| Other signatures | 40 | Various |

## Novel Cardiovascular Associations

A key finding: signature-based GWAS identifies loci not detected in single-trait GWAS of component diseases.

For SIG5 (cardiovascular signature), we identified **23 lead variants** annotated to genes including:
- IL6R (inflammation)
- SMAD3 (TGF-β signaling)
- ZPR1/ZNF259 (lipid metabolism)
- SCARB1 (HDL receptor)
- CFDP1 (complement)
- PDGFD (vascular biology)

These did not reach genome-wide significance as lead loci in our single-trait GWAS of angina, MI, coronary atherosclerosis, or hypercholesterolemia conducted on the same UK Biobank data.

## Why Signatures Have More Power

Signatures aggregate related diseases, increasing statistical power through:

1. **Larger effective sample size**: More "cases" when combining related conditions
2. **Reduced noise**: Common genetic signal amplified, disease-specific noise averaged out
3. **Biological coherence**: Variants affecting shared pathways detected

The heritability analysis (next chapter) confirms this quantitatively.

## Replication of Known Biology

Many identified loci replicate established biology:

**LPA (Lipoprotein(a))**
- Known causal risk factor for CAD
- Strong signal in SIG5

**PCSK9**
- Target of cholesterol-lowering drugs
- Strong signal in SIG5

**FTO**
- Established obesity gene
- Strong signal in SIG7 (Metabolic)

**TERT**
- Telomere maintenance, cancer susceptibility
- Strong signal in SIG11 (Cancer)

This replication validates the biological relevance of signatures.


# Rare Variant Associations (RVAS) {#rvas}

## Gene-Based Testing

While GWAS focuses on common variants, **rare variant association studies (RVAS)** test whether rare, potentially damaging variants in a gene collectively associate with phenotype.

We used REGENIE to perform gene-based RVAS with multiple variant masks:
- Mask 1: Loss-of-function (LoF) only
- Mask 2: LoF + predicted deleterious missense
- Mask 3: LoF + all missense
- Masks 4-6: Progressively inclusive categories

## Results: 18 Significant Genes

We identified **18 unique genes** with genome-wide significant associations across 21 signatures:

| Gene | Signature(s) | Known Biology |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| LDLR | SIG5 (CV) | LDL receptor, FH |
| LPA | SIG5 (CV) | Lipoprotein(a) |
| APOB | SIG5, SIG7 | Apolipoprotein B |
| TTN | SIG5, Multiple | Cardiomyopathy |
| BRCA2 | SIG11, SIG12 | DNA repair, cancer |
| TET2 | SIG5, SIG10 | CHIP, clonal hematopoiesis |
| PKD1 | Multiple | Polycystic kidney |
| MSH2 | Multiple | Lynch syndrome |
| DEFB1 | SIG20 | Defensin, immunity |

## Pleiotropic Effects

Several genes show associations across multiple signatures, indicating **pleiotropy**:

**BRCA2:**
- SIG11 (Cancer-general)
- SIG12 (Breast/GYN)
- Consistent with known breast/ovarian cancer risk

**PKD1:**
- SIG9 (Genitourinary)
- SIG5 (Cardiovascular)
- Consistent with kidney-cardiovascular axis

**TET2:**
- SIG5 (Cardiovascular)
- SIG10 (Hematologic)
- Consistent with CHIP biology

## Robust Across Masks

Seven genes were significant across all 6 variant masks:
- LDLR, LPA, APOB (lipid metabolism)
- CDH26 (cadherin)
- TTN (muscle structure)
- RAD52 (DNA repair)
- PKD1 (polycystic kidney)

This robustness to mask definition increases confidence in the associations.

## The DEFB1 Signal

An intriguing finding: DEFB1 (defensin beta 1) associated with the **healthy signature** (SIG20).

Defensins are antimicrobial peptides involved in innate immunity. The association with the healthy signature suggests a potential role in maintaining health/resisting disease.

This illustrates how ALADYNOULLI can identify biologically plausible relationships that wouldn't be found in traditional disease-focused GWAS.


# Heritability and Biological Relevance {#heritability}

## Observed-Scale Heritability

Heritability ($h^2$) measures the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetics. For binary diseases, two scales are used:

- **Liability scale**: Assumes an underlying continuous liability
- **Observed scale**: Based on the binary phenotype directly

Signatures are continuous phenotypes, so their heritability is inherently on the observed scale. To compare fairly with diseases, we compute disease heritability on the same observed scale.

## Signatures vs Component Diseases

A key finding: **signature heritability often exceeds component disease heritability**.

| Signature | h² (sig) | Top Disease | h² (disease) |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| SIG5 (CV) | 0.18 | CAD | 0.12 |
| SIG7 (Metabolic) | 0.22 | T2D | 0.15 |
| SIG11 (Cancer) | 0.14 | Breast Ca | 0.10 |
| SIG6 (Psychiatric) | 0.16 | Depression | 0.09 |

This makes sense: signatures aggregate genetic signal across related diseases, while disease-specific noise is averaged out.

## Why Aggregation Helps

Consider the genetic architecture:
- Variant A affects CAD (effect size β₁)
- Variant A also affects hyperlipidemia (effect size β₂)
- In single-disease GWAS: detected with power from one phenotype
- In signature GWAS: detected with combined power from both phenotypes

This is essentially a form of multi-trait analysis that increases effective sample size for shared genetic effects.

## Familial Hypercholesterolemia Validation

We validated that signatures capture genetic biology through enrichment analyses.

**FH carrier analysis:**
- Identified carriers of known FH-causing variants (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9)
- Compared signature values to non-carriers with similar LDL levels
- FH carriers had **higher SIG5 (cardiovascular) values**

This demonstrates that signatures capture genetic predisposition beyond what's visible in standard clinical measures.

## CHIP Carrier Validation

Similar validation with clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP):

- Identified carriers of CHIP-associated mutations (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1)
- CHIP carriers had elevated SIG5 (cardiovascular) and SIG10 (hematologic) values
- Consistent with known CHIP biology linking hematopoiesis to cardiovascular risk

## Genetic Correlation Structure

Signatures show interpretable genetic correlations:

```
Genetic Correlation Matrix (partial)
           SIG5   SIG6   SIG7   SIG11
SIG5 (CV)  1.00   0.25   0.45   0.15
SIG6 (Psy) 0.25   1.00   0.20   0.10
SIG7 (Met) 0.45   0.20   1.00   0.18
SIG11 (Ca) 0.15   0.10   0.18   1.00
```

- SIG5 and SIG7 show substantial correlation (cardiometabolic axis)
- SIG6 correlates with both (mental health-cardiovascular link)
- These correlations reflect known biology
