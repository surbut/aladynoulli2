# (PART) Discovering Disease Signatures {-}

# Latent Patterns of Disease {#latent-patterns}

## What is a Signature?

A **disease signature** is a pattern of diseases that tend to co-occur and share temporal dynamics. Rather than thinking of 348 diseases independently, signatures group them into clinically meaningful clusters.

Consider the cardiovascular signature (SIG5):
- Coronary atherosclerosis
- Angina pectoris
- Myocardial infarction
- Heart failure
- Hyperlipidemia
- Hypertension

These diseases share risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment targets. A patient with one is at elevated risk for the others. The signature captures this shared structure.

## Learning Signatures from Data

ALADYNOULLI learns signatures through the $\psi$ parameter, which encodes signature-disease associations:

$$\phi_{kd} = \sigma(\mu_d + \psi_{kd})$$

Diseases with high $\psi_{kd}$ are strongly associated with signature $k$; diseases with low (negative) $\psi_{kd}$ are weakly associated or negatively associated.

The learning process:
1. Initialize $\psi$ via spectral clustering on disease co-occurrence
2. Optimize jointly with other parameters
3. Signatures emerge that explain disease patterns

## The 21 Signatures

Across three biobanks, we identify 21 robust signatures:

| Signature | Primary Pattern | Key Diseases |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| SIG1 | Musculoskeletal | Osteoarthritis, back pain, joint disorders |
| SIG2 | Respiratory | COPD, asthma, pneumonia |
| SIG3 | Gastrointestinal | GERD, IBS, diverticulosis |
| SIG4 | Neurological | Headache, neuropathy, seizures |
| SIG5 | Cardiovascular | CAD, MI, heart failure, hypertension |
| SIG6 | Psychiatric | Depression, anxiety, insomnia |
| SIG7 | Metabolic | Diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome |
| SIG8 | Dermatological | Eczema, psoriasis, acne |
| SIG9 | Genitourinary | UTI, kidney stones, BPH |
| SIG10 | Hematologic | Anemia, bleeding disorders |
| SIG11 | Cancer-general | Multiple cancer types |
| SIG12 | Breast/GYN | Breast pathology, menstrual disorders |
| SIG13 | Autoimmune | RA, lupus, IBD |
| SIG14 | Infectious | Various infections |
| SIG15 | Endocrine | Thyroid disorders, other endocrine |
| SIG16 | Ophthalmologic | Cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration |
| SIG17 | ENT | Hearing loss, sinusitis, tonsillitis |
| SIG18 | Trauma/Injury | Fractures, sprains, accidents |
| SIG19 | Substance use | Alcohol, tobacco, drug disorders |
| SIG20 | Healthy | Low disease burden (reference) |
| SIG21 | Multi-system | Complex multi-organ involvement |

## Visualizing Signatures

Each signature can be visualized as a heatmap of disease associations:

```
Cardiovascular Signature (SIG5)
Disease                    Association (φ)
────────────────────────────────────────
Coronary atherosclerosis   ████████████ 0.85
Essential hypertension     ████████████ 0.82
Hyperlipidemia            ███████████  0.78
Angina pectoris           ██████████   0.72
Myocardial infarction     █████████    0.68
Heart failure             ████████     0.61
Atrial fibrillation       ███████      0.54
Stroke                    ██████       0.48
...
Depression                ██           0.15
Osteoarthritis            █            0.08
```

The signature shows strong associations with cardiovascular diseases and weaker associations with related conditions.

## Time-Varying Patterns

Signatures aren't static—they change over the lifespan:

```
θ (Cardiovascular signature proportion)
    ^
0.6 |                    ___________
    |                 __/
0.4 |              __/
    |           __/
0.2 |        __/
    |     __/
0.0 |____/
    +-------------------------> Age
    30    40    50    60    70    80
```

For many individuals, cardiovascular signature proportion increases with age as risk factors accumulate and events occur.

## The Healthy Signature

A unique feature of ALADYNOULLI is the **healthy signature** (SIG20):

- Negative associations with most diseases
- Represents absence of disease burden
- Individuals start with high healthy signature proportion
- Proportion decreases as diseases accumulate

This provides a natural baseline and helps with calibration.


# Consistency Across Populations {#cross-cohort}

## The Generalizability Challenge

A model that works in one population but fails in another has limited value. Disease signatures discovered in UK Biobank must replicate in Mass General Brigham and All of Us to be credible.

But these populations differ in important ways:
- **Demographics**: Age, sex, ancestry composition
- **Healthcare systems**: NHS vs US academic center vs multi-site US
- **Ascertainment**: Volunteer vs clinical cohort vs diversity-focused
- **Data quality**: ICD coding practices, completeness

Can signatures generalize across these differences?

## Measuring Similarity

We quantify cross-cohort signature similarity using the **Composition Preservation Probability Index (CPPI)**:

For each UKB signature, find its best match in the comparison cohort, then calculate:

$$\text{CPPI} = \frac{|\text{Diseases in both}|}{|\text{Diseases in UKB signature}|}$$

A CPPI of 0.80 means 80% of diseases in the UKB signature also appear in the matched signature of the comparison cohort.

## Results: Remarkable Consistency

Across all signature comparisons:

| Comparison | Median CPPI | Range |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| UKB vs MGB | 0.82 | 0.65-0.95 |
| UKB vs AoU | 0.78 | 0.60-0.92 |
| MGB vs AoU | 0.80 | 0.62-0.94 |
| **Combined** | **0.80** | 0.60-0.95 |

These results demonstrate that disease signatures capture **biologically fundamental** patterns that transcend healthcare systems and populations.

## What Stays the Same

The signature-disease associations ($\phi$, $\psi$) show high stability:
- Cardiovascular diseases cluster together across all three biobanks
- Cancer signatures maintain their composition
- Psychiatric patterns replicate

This suggests $\phi$ captures **invariant biological relationships**.

## What Adapts

The individual trajectories ($\lambda$, $\theta$) adapt to local population characteristics:
- Prevalence differences (higher obesity in US)
- Age distributions (different enrollment criteria)
- Healthcare utilization patterns

This is appropriate: $\lambda$ should reflect the population being modeled.

## Implications for Clinical Use

Cross-cohort consistency has practical implications:

1. **Model transfer**: Signatures learned in UKB can inform predictions in other populations
2. **Biological validity**: Consistent patterns are more likely to reflect biology
3. **Generalizability**: Results are not artifacts of a single dataset


# Heterogeneity Within Disease {#heterogeneity}

## Beyond Diagnostic Categories

Traditional diagnostic codes (ICD, phecodes) group patients into categories: "Type 2 diabetes," "Major depressive disorder," "Breast cancer." But within each category, patients differ enormously in:

- Disease severity and trajectory
- Comorbidity patterns
- Treatment response
- Outcomes

ALADYNOULLI reveals this **within-disease heterogeneity** through signature profiles.

## Case Study: Breast Cancer

Consider 10,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer. All share the same diagnostic code, but their signature profiles differ:

**Cluster A** (40% of patients):
- High SIG12 (Breast/GYN): Primary breast pathology
- Low other signatures
- Younger age at diagnosis
- Better prognosis

**Cluster B** (35% of patients):
- High SIG12 + High SIG7 (Metabolic)
- Obesity, diabetes comorbidity
- Older age at diagnosis
- Intermediate prognosis

**Cluster C** (25% of patients):
- High SIG12 + High SIG11 (Cancer-general) + High SIG21 (Multi-system)
- Multiple malignancies
- Complex comorbidity
- Worse prognosis

These clusters have different biology, different risk factors, and different outcomes—all within "breast cancer."

## Quantifying Heterogeneity

We measure signature differences between patient clusters using **Cohen's d**:

$$d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma_{\text{pooled}}}$$

Results across diseases:
- Mean Cohen's d: 2.1 (large effect)
- Maximum Cohen's d: 4.25 (very large effect)
- 95% of comparisons: p < 10⁻⁸

These are not subtle differences—patients within the same diagnostic category have dramatically different signature profiles.

## Case Study: Major Depression

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) cluster into distinct subtypes:

**Subtype 1: Pure psychiatric**
- High SIG6 (Psychiatric)
- Anxiety, insomnia comorbidity
- Earlier onset
- Responds to standard antidepressants

**Subtype 2: Cardiometabolic**
- High SIG6 + High SIG5 (Cardiovascular) + High SIG7 (Metabolic)
- Obesity, diabetes, hypertension
- Later onset
- May need integrated treatment

**Subtype 3: Pain-predominant**
- High SIG6 + High SIG1 (Musculoskeletal)
- Chronic pain comorbidity
- Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue overlap
- May benefit from pain-focused interventions

## Case Study: Myocardial Infarction

MI patients also show signature heterogeneity:

**Subtype 1: Classic atherosclerotic**
- High SIG5 (Cardiovascular)
- Long history of risk factors
- Older age

**Subtype 2: Metabolic-driven**
- High SIG5 + High SIG7 (Metabolic)
- Diabetes-related
- May benefit from aggressive metabolic management

**Subtype 3: Inflammatory**
- High SIG5 + High SIG13 (Autoimmune)
- Inflammatory component
- May respond to anti-inflammatory therapy

## Clinical Implications

Within-disease heterogeneity has implications for:

1. **Precision medicine**: Same diagnosis ≠ same treatment
2. **Prognosis**: Signature profiles predict outcomes beyond diagnostic codes
3. **Trial design**: Heterogeneous populations may obscure treatment effects
4. **Biological understanding**: Different etiologies within a diagnosis

## Heterogeneity Matches Genotype

Remarkably, these clinically-defined subtypes show genetic differences:

- Patients cluster by signature profile
- Clusters have different polygenic risk scores
- Genetic heterogeneity mirrors phenotypic heterogeneity

This suggests the subtypes reflect distinct biological processes with different genetic architectures.
